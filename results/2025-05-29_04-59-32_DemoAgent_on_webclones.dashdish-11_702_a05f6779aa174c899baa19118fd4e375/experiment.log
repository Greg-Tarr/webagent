I can see the "Chicken Biryani" is listed in the "Most Liked Items From The Menu" section and it shows a price of $17.11. However, I need to find the medium size specifically. Let me scroll down to see if there's a full menu where I can find different sizes for the Chicken Biryani.

I should note that I can see one Chicken Biryani listed for $17.11, but I need to check if this is the medium size or if there are different size options available. Let me scroll down to see the full menu.

I can see there's a Chicken Biryani listed in the "Most Liked Items" section for $17.11, but I need to find specifically the medium size. The user wants me to:

1. Find the price of a medium Chicken Biryani
2. Add one to the cart
3. Buy it 
4. Tell them the total price

I can see the Chicken Biryani is listed but I need to check if this is the medium size or if there are different size options. Let me continue scrolling to see if there's a full menu with different sizes, or I might need to click on the Chicken Biryani item to see size options.

Actually, let me try clicking on the Chicken Biryani item itself to see if it opens a modal with size options.

action:
click(bid="358")

2025-05-29 05:00:45,707 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 05:00:45,762 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm on the Mashaallah Halal Food Pakistani Food restaurant page
2. I can see a Chicken Biryani for $17.11 in the "Most Liked Items" section
3. I clicked on the Chicken Biryani item but the page state didn't change, which suggests either:
   - The click didn't work
   - There's no modal or additional options to show
   - I need to try a different approach

The goal is to find out how much a medium 'Chicken Biryani' costs specifically. The current listing shows $17.11 but doesn't specify the size. I need to check if this is the medium size or if there are multiple size options available.

Let me try clicking on the "Add" button for the Chicken Biryani instead, as that might open up a modal with size options.

action:
click(bid="355")

2025-05-29 05:00:56,432 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 05:00:56,491 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Now I can see the Chicken Biryani modal with size options:

1. Small • 230 cal - (base price)
2. Medium • 320 cal • +$0.90 - (this is what I need)
3. Large • 480 cal • +$1.60 - (currently selected)

I can see that Large is currently selected and the price shows $18.71. If Large adds $1.60, and Medium adds $0.90, I need to calculate the base price and then the medium price.

But wait, let me think about this more carefully. The current price showing is $18.71 and Large is selected with +$1.60. So the base price (Small) would be $18.71 - $1.60 = $17.11. And the Medium would be $17.11 + $0.90 = $18.01.

Let me select Medium first to confirm the price, then add it to cart and proceed with the purchase.

action:
click(bid="702")

So the medium Chicken Biryani costs $18.01. Now I need to add it to the cart and proceed with the purchase. Let me click the "Add to cart $18.01" button.

action:
click(bid="739")
