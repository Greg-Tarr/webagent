2025-05-29 05:13:58,736 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to find the price of a regular "Chicken Biryani" from "Mashaallah Halal Food Pakistani Food" restaurant. Let me first examine the current page.

Looking at the current state, I can see this is a food delivery app (DashDish) homepage. I can see "Mashaallah Halal Food Pakistani Food" is indeed listed on the page as one of the restaurants:

```

Perfect! I can see the restaurant is already displayed on the homepage. I need to click on it to go to their menu and find the Chicken Biryani price. Let me click on the restaurant heading.

action:
click(bid="650")

2025-05-29 05:14:13,042 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I can see I'm now on the restaurant page for "Mashaallah Halal Food Pakistani Food". I can see the "Most Liked Items From The Menu" section which shows several items including "Chicken Biryani". 

Looking at the Chicken Biryani item, I can see:
- Heading: "Chicken Biryani"
- Price: "$17.11"
- It shows "#1 Most Liked"

The question asks for the price of a regular "Chicken Biryani" from "Mashaallah Halal Food Pakistani Food", and I can see it right here on the page showing $17.11.

However, I should double-check that this is the regular version and not a special version. The item just says "Chicken Biryani" without any qualifiers like "large" or "small", so this appears to be the regular version.

Let me make sure I haven't missed anything and that this is the correct answer. The price is clearly displayed as "$17.11" for the "Chicken Biryani" item.

action:
send_msg_to_user(text="The price of a regular \"Chicken Biryani\" from \"Mashaallah Halal Food Pakistani Food\" is $17.11.")
