1. Account details: shaun.t.vanweelden@gmail.com

3. Payment details: VISA card ending in 5097 is already selected
4. Order summary shows the Mushroom Swiss Burger - Large for $18.01
5. Current total is $26.67

1. The Express delivery option is now checked (radio button shows checked='true')
2. The Standard delivery option is now unchecked (radio button shows checked='false')
3. The delivery time changed from "45-60 min" to "30-35 min" 
4. The delivery fee increased from $2.99 to $5.98 (which makes sense since Express has +$2.99 fee)
5. The total order amount increased from $26.67 to $29.66

Everything looks correct:
- ✓ DragonEats restaurant
- ✓ Mushroom Swiss Burger - Large ($18.01)

- ✓ Pre-loaded Visa card ending in 5097
