2025-05-29 06:48:40,505 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to search for a Premium Economy flight from Indiana to New York at 12:00 on December 2nd and find the price. Let me break this down:

1. I'm on an airline booking website 
2. I need to fill out the flight search form with:
   - From: Indiana (need to specify an airport in Indiana)
   - To: New York (need to specify an airport in New York)
   - Date: December 2nd 
   - Time: 12:00
   - Class: Premium Economy
3. Then search for flights and find the price

Looking at the current page, I can see:
- There's a flight booking form
- Origin field (combobox for "From")
- Destination field (combobox for "To") 
- Dates field
- Travel Class dropdown (currently showing "Economy")
- Travelers field (showing "1 Adult")

Let me start by filling out the form step by step.

First, I need to specify the origin (Indiana). I should click on the origin combobox.

action:
click(bid="214")

- Fort Wayne, IN, US (FWA) - this is option [2374] 
- South Bend, IN, US (SBN) - this is option [2516]

I should select Indianapolis (IND) as it's the main airport in Indiana. Let me click on that option.

action:
click(bid="1195")

1. Select the destination airport (New York)
2. Set the date to December 2nd
3. Change the class to Premium Economy
4. Search for flights
5. Look for flights at 12:00

Let me continue by clicking on the destination field to select a New York airport.

action:
click(bid="234")

- Origin: Indianapolis IND (Indiana)
- Destination: New York/Newark EWR (New York area)

Now I need to:
1. Set the date to December 2nd
2. Check if I need to change from "Roundtrip" to "One-way" since the user didn't specify return
3. Set the travel class to Premium Economy (currently shows "Economy")
4. Search for flights
5. Look for a flight at 12:00 and find the price

The current view shows May and June 2025, but I need December. I need to change the month to December. I can see there's a dropdown for the month (value='May') and another for the year (value='2025'). Since I need December 2nd and the user didn't specify a year, I should assume they mean the next available December 2nd, which would be December 2024 (since we're currently in 2025 according to the calendar). Let me first change the year to 2024, then change the month to December.

Let me click on the year dropdown first.

Looking at the available flights, I can see multiple options with different departure times and prices for Premium Economy:

1. Flight departing 8:00 AM arriving 12:44 PM - Premium Economy $283
2. Flight departing 10:00 AM arriving 2:11 PM - Premium Economy $323
3. Flight departing 12:00 PM arriving 4:33 PM - Premium Economy $353
4. Flight departing 2:00 PM arriving 4:10 PM - Premium Economy $335
5. Flight departing 4:00 PM arriving 7:19 PM - Premium Economy $326

The user specifically asked for the price of a Premium Economy flight at 12:00 on December 2nd. Looking at the results, I can see there is a flight that departs at exactly 12:00 PM (12:00 noon) from IND to EWR, and the Premium Economy price for that flight is $353.

Wait, let me double-check: the user asked for "at 12:00" - this could mean 12:00 PM (noon) or 12:00 AM (midnight). Since flights typically don't depart at midnight, and I can see a 12:00 PM flight in the results, I'll assume they meant 12:00 PM.

The flight details show:
- Departure: 12:00 PM from IND
- Arrival: 4:33 PM at EWR  
- Duration: 4h 33m
- Premium Economy price: $353

This answers the user's question perfectly. The price for a Premium Economy flight from Indiana to New York at 12:00 on December 2nd is $353.

Actually, let me take a screenshot first as recommended in the instructions to make sure I'm seeing the correct information visually.
