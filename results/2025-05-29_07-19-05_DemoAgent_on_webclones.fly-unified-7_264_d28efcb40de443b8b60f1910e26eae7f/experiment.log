2025-05-29 07:19:23,322 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The user wants to know how many flights are available from Dallas to Fresno on December 4th. I need to:

1. First, I should examine the current page, which appears to be an airline booking website
2. Fill in the search form with the proper information:
   - Origin: Dallas
   - Destination: Fresno  
   - Date: December 4th
3. Search for flights
4. Count how many flights are available

Looking at the current state, I can see this is an Airlines Airways website with a flight booking form. The form has:
- Origin field (combobox with ID 214)
- Destination field (combobox with ID 234) 
- Dates field (textbox with ID 250)
- Travelers field (seems to be set to "1 Adult")
- Travel class dropdown (set to "Economy")
- "Find flights" button (ID 289)

The form appears to be set to "Roundtrip" by default, but since the user is asking about flights on a specific date, I should probably switch to "One-way" to get a cleaner view of just that day's flights.

Let me start by filling out the form:
1. Switch to one-way
2. Fill in origin as Dallas
3. Fill in destination as Fresno
4. Set the date to December 4th
5. Search for flights
6. Count the results

Let me start:

2. Fill in the destination (Fresno) 
3. Set the departure date to December 4th
4. Search for flights
5. Count the number of available flights

1. First change the year to 2024
2. Then change the month to December  
3. Then select the 4th day

I can see the month dropdown shows "May" and there are navigation arrows. I see the year dropdown shows "2025". Let me try to click on the year dropdown to change it to 2024.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see the date picker is open and shows May 2025 and June 2025. I need to navigate to December 2024. I can see dropdowns for "May" and "2025" at the top.

I notice that I've been struggling with this date picker for a while now. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe I should try to navigate back and try a simpler approach, or try using the previous/next buttons to navigate to December 2024.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see the month dropdown shows "May" and the year dropdown shows "2025". I need to:
1. Change the year to 2024
2. Change the month to December

Looking at the flight results, I can see:

1. 8:00 AM - 11:28 AM (DFW to FAT, 3h 28m, 0 STOP)
2. 10:00 AM - 1:37 PM (DFW to FAT, 3h 37m, 0 STOP) 
3. 12:00 PM - 4:01 PM (DFW to FAT, 4h 1m, 0 STOP)
4. 2:00 PM - 4:06 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 6m, 0 STOP)
5. 4:00 PM - 6:29 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 29m, 0 STOP)

So there are 5 flights available from Dallas to Fresno on December 4th.

Before I submit my answer, let me double-check this is all the flights by scrolling or checking if there are more results. I can see each flight has multiple fare options (Basic Economy, Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First) but these are fare types for the same flight, not different flights.

Let me take a screenshot to confirm what I'm seeing before giving my final answer.

1. Flight 1: 8:00 AM - 11:28 AM (DFW to FAT, 3h 28m)
2. Flight 2: 10:00 AM - 1:37 PM (DFW to FAT, 3h 37m) 
3. Flight 3: 12:00 PM - 4:01 PM (DFW to FAT, 4h 1m)
4. Flight 4: 2:00 PM - 4:06 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 6m)
5. Flight 5: 4:00 PM - 6:29 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 29m)

Let me scroll down a bit more to make sure I've seen all flights, then check if there are any pagination buttons or if this is the complete list.

action:
scroll(delta_x=0, delta_y=300)

2025-05-29 07:27:28,442 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me carefully count the flights based on the state information I've seen. From the page state, I can see there are multiple listitem elements that represent flights:

From the state, I can see these flight times that represent different flights:

1. 8:00 AM - 11:28 AM (DFW to FAT, 3h 28m)
2. 10:00 AM - 1:37 PM (DFW to FAT, 3h 37m)
3. 12:00 PM - 4:01 PM (DFW to FAT, 4h 1m)
4. 2:00 PM - 4:06 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 6m)
5. 4:00 PM - 6:29 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 29m)

Let me take a screenshot to visually confirm this and make sure I haven't missed any or that there are no pagination controls.

2025-05-29 07:27:42,128 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Now I can see the bottom of the page and I can count all the flights. I can see in the current screenshot:

1. Flight at 2:00 PM - 4:06 PM (DFW to FAT)
2. Flight at 4:00 PM - 6:29 PM (DFW to FAT)

And from my earlier scrolling, I saw:

1. Flight at 8:00 AM - 11:28 AM (DFW to FAT)
2. Flight at 10:00 AM - 1:37 PM (DFW to FAT)
3. Flight at 12:00 PM - 4:01 PM (DFW to FAT)

So in total, I've seen 5 flights. Let me scroll back up to verify this and make sure I have the complete count.

From the state information I can see these flights listed:
1. 8:00 AM - 11:28 AM (3h 28m)
2. 10:00 AM - 1:37 PM (3h 37m)  
3. 12:00 PM - 4:01 PM (4h 1m)
4. 2:00 PM - 4:06 PM (2h 6m)
5. 4:00 PM - 6:29 PM (2h 29m)

I can see the footer which indicates I've reached the end of the page, and there are no pagination controls visible. So there are 5 flights total available from Dallas to Fresno on December 4th.

Let me take one more screenshot to confirm before giving my final answer.

action:
scroll(delta_x=0, delta_y=-1200)

2025-05-29 07:27:55,668 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Now I need to carefully count all the flights I've seen. From my exploration, I have carefully reviewed the entire flight list. Let me count the flights based on what I've observed:

From the state information and my scrolling through the page, I can see the following flights:

1. Flight 1: 8:00 AM - 11:28 AM (DFW to FAT, 3h 28m)
2. Flight 2: 10:00 AM - 1:37 PM (DFW to FAT, 3h 37m) 
3. Flight 3: 12:00 PM - 4:01 PM (DFW to FAT, 4h 1m)
4. Flight 4: 2:00 PM - 4:06 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 6m)
5. Flight 5: 4:00 PM - 6:29 PM (DFW to FAT, 2h 29m)

These correspond to the listitem elements I saw in the state:
- [5849] listitem '' (first flight)
- [5934] listitem '' (second flight) 
- [6019] listitem '' (third flight)
- [6104] listitem '' (fourth flight)
- [6189] listitem '' (fifth flight)

I scrolled through the entire page and reached the footer, so I'm confident I've seen all available flights. There were no pagination controls or "next page" buttons, indicating this is the complete list.

Let me take one final screenshot to double-check before providing my answer, as the instructions emphasize taking a screenshot before submitting, especially for flights.

I've scrolled through the entire page and reached the footer, so there are no more flights beyond these. I haven't seen any pagination controls or "next page" buttons, which means this is the complete list.
 
I've confirmed the total number of available flights matches exactly. Five distinct travel options connect Dallas and Fresno throughout the day, providing travelers with multiple departure time choices.
