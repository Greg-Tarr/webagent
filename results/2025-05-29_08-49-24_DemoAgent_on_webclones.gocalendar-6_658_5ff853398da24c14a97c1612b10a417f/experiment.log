2025-05-29 08:49:41,363 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to assign color codes to calendars - sage color to "Personal" calendar and peacock color to "Work" calendar.

Looking at the current state, I can see a calendar interface with:
- Three calendars listed under "My calendars": Work, Family, and Personal
- Each has a checkbox that's currently checked

To assign color codes to calendars, I need to find where I can configure calendar settings or properties. This would likely be in a settings menu or by right-clicking on the calendar names.

Let me start by exploring the interface to see if there are any obvious ways to access calendar settings. I can see the three calendars:
- Work (checkbox 124)
- Family (checkbox 132) 
- Personal (checkbox 141)

I should try clicking on one of the calendar names or looking for a settings/configuration option. Let me start by trying to right-click on one of the calendar names to see if there's a context menu.

Actually, let me first try left-clicking on the "Personal" calendar text to see if that opens any settings.

action:
click(bid="143")

2025-05-29 08:49:53,370 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at the current state, I can see that I clicked on the Personal calendar and it appears that checkbox [141] is now unchecked (changed from checked='true' to checked='false') and focused. The Personal calendar events seem to have disappeared from the calendar view (the "Coffee with Mentor", "Dinner and Movie", "Reading Time", and "Workout Session" events are no longer showing).

This suggests that clicking on the calendar name toggles the visibility of the calendar, but it doesn't seem to open any color settings. I need to find a different way to access the calendar color settings.

Let me try a few different approaches:
1. Right-click on the calendar name to see if there's a context menu
2. Look for settings or options buttons elsewhere on the interface
3. Try clicking on the checkbox or other elements around the calendar

Let me try right-clicking on the "Personal" calendar text to see if there's a context menu.

action:
click(bid="143", button="right")

- Sage color code to the "Personal" calendar
- Peacock color code to the "Work" calendar

I need to figure out how to access calendar color settings. Right-clicking on the Personal calendar didn't seem to bring up a context menu. Let me try looking for other options.

I could try:
1. Looking for a settings or configuration button somewhere on the interface
2. Clicking on the colored squares or color indicators next to calendar names
3. Looking for a menu or settings icon
4. Checking if there are any dropdown menus or gear icons

Let me first check if there are any color indicators next to the calendar names that I can click on. Looking at the current state, I see there are checkboxes for each calendar, but I don't see explicit color indicators in the text. However, there might be visual color squares that aren't described in the accessibility tree.

Let me try clicking on different parts of the calendar interface to see if I can find settings. Maybe I should look for a settings menu or gear icon. I can see there's an "apps" button at the top right - let me try that.

action:
click(bid="186")

- Peacock color code to the "Work" calendar

So far I've tried:
1. Clicking on the Personal calendar text (which just unchecked it)
2. Right-clicking on the Personal calendar text (no context menu appeared)
3. Clicking the apps button (which just focused it, but no dropdown or menu appeared)

The apps button click didn't open anything visible. Let me try a different approach. Let me look for other interface elements that might lead to calendar settings.

I should try clicking on the user profile image to see if there are account/settings options there.

1. Clicking on the Personal calendar text - that just unchecked the calendar
2. Right-clicking on it - no context menu appeared
3. Clicking the apps button - no menu appeared
4. Clicking the user profile image - no response

I need to find where calendar color settings are located. Let me think about other possible places:

1. Maybe there's a settings menu somewhere else
2. Maybe I need to look for a gear icon or settings icon
3. Maybe the color settings are accessed through a different method
4. Maybe I need to go to a different URL or page

Let me try a few more approaches:
- Look for any gear/settings icons on the page
- Try hovering over calendar names to see if there are options
- Try looking at the calendar list area more carefully
- Maybe there's a dropdown or menu I'm missing

Let me try hovering over the Personal calendar name to see if any options appear.

action:
hover(bid="143")

1. Clicked on the Personal calendar text - this just unchecked the checkbox
2. Right-clicked on the Personal calendar text - no context menu appeared
3. Clicked on the apps button - nothing happened
4. Clicked on the user profile image - nothing happened
5. Hovered over the Personal calendar name - no options appeared

I notice that the calendars are currently showing as checkboxes with labels. Maybe I need to look for some kind of settings button or gear icon near the calendars, or perhaps there's a way to access calendar settings through a different route.

Let me think about other possibilities:
- Maybe there's a settings page I can navigate to directly
- Maybe I need to look for a gear icon or settings icon somewhere
- Maybe the color settings are accessible through the "Create event" menu
- Maybe I need to look at the URL structure and navigate to a settings page

Let me try looking for any gear icons or settings buttons on the page. I should also try the "Create event" menu to see if calendar settings are accessible from there.

Let me start by trying the Create event button to see if it has calendar settings.

action:
click(bid="46")

This doesn't seem to be the right path for calendar color settings though. Let me close this menu and try a different approach.

Let me think about where calendar color settings might be located in typical calendar applications:
1. In calendar settings or preferences
2. In a calendar management area
3. Through a right-click menu on calendar names
4. In a separate calendar configuration page

I should try to look for any settings or configuration options. Let me close this menu first and then try looking at the URL structure to see if there might be a settings page I can navigate to directly.

2025-05-29 08:50:59,066 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to find how to assign color codes to calendars in this calendar interface. Let me think about what I've tried so far:

1. Clicked on Personal calendar checkbox - just toggled it off/on
2. Right-clicked on Personal calendar - no context menu
3. Clicked apps button - no menu appeared
4. Clicked user profile image - no menu appeared
5. Hovered over Personal calendar - no options
6. Clicked Create event button - opened event creation menu, not calendar settings

I need to explore more systematically. Let me think about where calendar color settings would typically be found in a calendar application:

1. Calendar settings/preferences
2. Right-click menu on calendar names
3. Calendar list management area
4. Somewhere in the sidebar where calendars are displayed

Looking at the current state, I can see there are calendars listed:
- Work (with checkbox)
- Family (with checkbox) 
- Personal (with checkbox)

Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me see if there are any visual indicators near the calendar names that I missed. Or maybe I need to try accessing settings through a different menu or URL.

Let me try exploring if there's a settings URL I can navigate to directly, or if there are other interface elements I haven't tried yet.

Actually, let me try taking a screenshot first to see the visual layout better, then try some other approaches.

action:
take_screenshot()

2025-05-29 08:51:09,313 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Now I can see the visual layout much better! I can see:

1. The "My calendars" section on the left sidebar with three calendars:
   - Work (with a blue/cyan checkbox checked)
   - Family (with an orange/red checkbox checked) 
   - Personal (with a checkbox that appears unchecked and has a white/empty background)

2. I can see the calendar colors are already visually represented by the colored checkboxes next to each calendar name.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see that each calendar has a colored square/checkbox next to it that represents its current color. The Work calendar appears to have a blue/cyan color, Family has an orange/red color, and Personal appears to have no color or a white color (unchecked).

I need to find a way to change these colors. Let me try clicking on the colored checkbox/square next to the "Work" calendar to see if that opens a color picker.

action:
click(bid="124")

2025-05-29 08:51:21,101 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I clicked on the Work calendar checkbox and it unchecked it, hiding all the Work events from the calendar view. This isn't what I wanted - I was hoping clicking on the colored checkbox would open a color picker or settings menu. Let me think about other approaches.

Looking at the state changes, all the Work calendar events disappeared when I unchecked the Work calendar, which confirms that clicking the checkbox just toggles the calendar visibility on/off, not color settings.

I need to find a different way to access color settings. Let me try:
1. Right-clicking on the actual calendar name text "Work" instead of the checkbox
2. Looking for a settings menu or gear icon
3. Trying to navigate to a different URL that might have calendar settings
4. Looking for three dots or menu indicators near the calendar names

Let me first re-check the Work calendar to make it visible again, then try right-clicking on the text "Work".

In Google Calendar interfaces, there's often a way to access calendar settings by clicking on a menu or settings icon next to each calendar. Let me try right-clicking directly on the text "Work" to see if there's a context menu.

Actually, let me first re-enable the Personal calendar as well since I need to set colors for both calendars. I notice the Personal calendar is currently unchecked.

action:
click(bid="141")

2025-05-29 08:51:45,149 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Good, now Personal calendar is enabled and I can see more events have appeared on the calendar. Now I need to find a way to access calendar color settings. Let me think about other ways to access calendar configuration:

1. I've tried clicking the checkboxes (which only toggle visibility)
2. I've tried right-clicking (no context menu)
3. I've tried the apps button (no menu)
4. I've tried the user profile (no menu)
5. I've tried the create event button (shows event creation, not calendar settings)

Let me try some other approaches:
- Maybe there's a settings gear icon somewhere I missed
- Maybe I need to try accessing calendar settings through the URL
- Maybe there's a three-dot menu or other settings option near the calendar names
- Maybe I need to look for a settings link in the top navigation

Let me try looking for any other clickable elements or try a different approach. From the screenshot I took earlier, I remember seeing the interface pretty clearly. Let me try clicking on the gear/settings icon if there is one.

I should also try going to a settings URL directly or see if there are other navigation options I missed.

2. Through a settings menu in the main interface
3. Through a three-dot menu or options menu next to calendar names
4. Through a settings or gear icon in the top toolbar

I've already tried right-clicking on the calendar names without success. Let me try to look for other options. From the screenshot I saw earlier, there was a gear/settings icon in the top toolbar. Let me check what elements are available in the top area that might be settings.

Looking at the state, I can see elements like:
- [186] button 'apps' - which I already tried

2. I can see there's a three-dot menu icon (⋯) next to the "Personal" calendar entry. This is likely where I can access calendar settings including color options.

3. I can also see there's a settings icon (gear) in the top right of the interface.

2. I tried clicking on the user profile image and apps icon, but those didn't work
3. I tried right-clicking on the Personal calendar text, but no context menu appeared

Looking at the interface again, I notice there might be a settings gear icon in the top right area. From the screenshot I saw earlier, there was a settings/gear icon in the top toolbar. Let me try clicking on that.

From the state, I can see there are various elements in the top toolbar. Let me look for a settings icon. I think I saw a gear/settings icon at element bid 1045, but that didn't work. Let me check other elements in the top toolbar area.

Looking at the current state, I see these elements in the top area:
- [159] button 'Toogle sidebar'
- [162] image 'logo'
- [164] paragraph with '18'
- [165] paragraph 'GoCalendar'
- [167] button 'Go to today'

I can see from the DOM structure that there are three calendars in the "My calendars" section:
- Work (bid 137)
- Family (bid 145) 
- Personal (bid 154)

Each has a checkbox (bids 135, 143, 152) that can be checked/unchecked to show/hide the calendar.

I need to find a way to change the colors. Let me take a screenshot first to see if there are any visual elements like three-dot menus or settings icons next to each calendar that I can access.

1. Work - with a cyan/turquoise checkbox color
2. Family - with an orange/red checkbox color 
3. Personal - with a purple/blue checkbox color

I need to change:
- Work calendar to peacock color
- Personal calendar to sage color

I can see each calendar has a colored checkbox next to it. I need to find a way to access color settings for these calendars. Let me try clicking on the colored checkbox or area next to each calendar name to see if it opens color options.

Let me try right-clicking on the Work calendar's colored checkbox to see if there's a context menu.

1. In the top-right area, I can see what looks like a settings/gear icon
2. There are various buttons and menu items
3. I need to find a way to access calendar settings

Looking at the screenshot, I can see in the top right:
- A search icon
- A question mark icon (help)

   - Personal (with a purple colored checkbox)

2. Most importantly, I notice there are three dots (⋯) next to "Work" in the sidebar! This is likely the menu for calendar settings.

3. In the top toolbar, I can see a gear/settings icon.

Let me try clicking on the three dots next to "Work" first since that's most likely to give me calendar-specific settings.

1. Work (checkbox checked)
2. Family (checkbox checked)  
3. Personal (checkbox checked)

I need to assign:
- Sage color code to the "Personal" calendar
- Peacock color code to the "Work" calendar

I've tried several approaches without success:
1. Clicking on calendar names - didn't work
2. Right-clicking on calendar names - didn't work
3. Hovering over calendar names - didn't work
4. Trying to access through event editing - didn't reveal color settings
5. Looking for settings/gear icons - couldn't find working ones
6. Trying different URLs - didn't work

Let me try a different approach. Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state and look for any options I might have missed.

2025-05-29 08:57:55,753 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Now I can see the visual layout very clearly. In the screenshot, I can see:

1. In the left sidebar under "My calendars", there are three calendars with colored checkboxes:
   - Work (with a cyan/turquoise colored checkbox) - this needs to change to peacock
   - Family (with an orange/red colored checkbox)
   - Personal (with a purple/blue colored checkbox) - this needs to change to sage

2. Looking at the events in the calendar, I can see they're color-coded:
   - Work events are showing in orange/red (like "Team Standup Meeting")
   - Personal events are showing in purple (like "Morning Walk")
   - Family events are showing in red (like "Morning Coffee with sister")

But wait, I need to be very careful here. Looking at the calendar checkboxes in the sidebar:
- Work has a cyan/blue checkbox
- Family has an orange/red checkbox 
- Personal has a purple/blue checkbox

But looking at the actual events:
- "Team Standup Meeting" (Work) is showing in orange
- "Morning Walk" (Personal) is showing in purple
- "Morning Coffee with sister" (Family) is showing in red

This suggests the colors I see in the checkboxes might not be the actual calendar colors being used for events.

I need to find a way to access calendar color settings. I've tried:
1. Right-clicking on calendar names - didn't work
2. Clicking on the three dots next to calendars - didn't open settings
3. Clicking on colored checkboxes - just toggles visibility
4. Looking for settings menus - haven't found any
5. Accessing through event editing - didn't provide calendar color options

Let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a settings icon in the top toolbar that I haven't tried yet. I can see there's a gear/settings icon in the top right corner of the screenshot. Let me try clicking on that.

2. The events on the calendar are also color-coded:

   - Family events appear to be in orange/red
   - Personal events appear to be in purple/blue

I need to:
- Change Work calendar to peacock color
- Change Personal calendar to sage color

Looking at the screenshot more carefully, I notice there are small colored squares/checkboxes next to each calendar name in the sidebar. These are likely clickable to access color settings.

Let me try right-clicking on the colored square next to "Work" to see if there's a context menu for color options.

1. Right-clicking on calendar names and checkboxes
2. Trying to access settings through the top toolbar
3. Clicking on events and their options
4. Trying different URLs like /settings or /config
5. Refreshing the page

None of these approaches have provided access to calendar color settings. 

Let me think about this differently. Looking at the screenshot, I can see that the calendar application looks very much like Google Calendar. In Google Calendar, you typically change calendar colors by:

1. Going to the calendar settings
2. Or right-clicking on the calendar name
3. Or clicking on the three dots next to the calendar name

Wait, I notice in the screenshot that there might be a settings gear icon in the top right corner. Let me try clicking on that gear icon I can see in the screenshot.

Actually, let me try a completely different approach. What if the color settings are accessible through a different URL path? Let me try navigating to a calendar admin or settings page.

But first, let me try clicking on the hamburger menu (three lines) in the top left to see if there are any settings options there.

Actually, looking at the screenshot more carefully, I can see there's a settings gear icon in the top right corner. Let me try clicking on that.

Wait, I need to be more systematic. Let me try clicking on the "My calendars" dropdown arrow to see if it expands with options.

Looking at my attempts so far:
1. I've tried right-clicking on calendar names
2. I've tried clicking on the colored checkboxes 
3. I've tried looking for settings icons
4. I've tried accessing through event editing
5. I've tried navigating to settings URLs
6. I've tried the dropdown arrow next to "My calendars"

None of these approaches have given me access to calendar color settings. Let me think about this differently. 

Maybe I need to try:
- Clicking on the settings gear icon that might be visible in the top right
- Trying keyboard shortcuts
- Looking for a different menu or settings option
- Checking if there's a three-dot menu next to individual calendars that I haven't tried yet

I need to find a way to change:
- Work calendar to peacock color
- Personal calendar to sage color

I've tried many approaches but haven't found calendar color settings yet. Let me try exploring if there are any right-click menus on the calendar name text itself, or perhaps look for a settings page through a different approach.

Let me try clicking on one of the calendar names (text) to see if that provides any options.

2. Looking for settings icons
3. Trying different URL paths
4. Clicking on the three dots next to calendars (but that just changed the view)
5. Going through event editing interface

None of these have worked so far. Let me think about other possible approaches:

1. Maybe the color settings are accessed through a different interface element I haven't tried
2. Maybe there's a specific sequence of actions needed
3. Maybe I need to look more carefully at the visual interface for other options

Let me go back to the calendar page and take a fresh screenshot to see if there are any visual elements I might have missed.

So far I've tried:
1. Clicking on the calendar checkboxes - this just toggles visibility
2. Right-clicking on various elements - no context menus appear
3. Clicking on three dots that seemed like menu options - they just changed the view
4. Clicking on the Settings gear icon - couldn't find the right element ID
5. Going through event editing - didn't provide calendar color options
6. Trying different URL paths - they don't exist

Let me think about this differently. Maybe the calendar colors are configured somewhere else, or maybe this calendar application doesn't actually support changing calendar colors and they are predefined. 

But the goal specifically asks me to assign sage to Personal and peacock to Work, so there must be a way. Let me try a few more approaches:

1. Maybe there's a settings menu accessible through the user profile image
2. Maybe there's an admin or configuration page
3. Maybe I need to look more carefully at the interface for any other settings options

Let me first close this notification alert and then take a screenshot to see the interface clearly.

- Maybe there's a menu hidden behind hover states
- Maybe I need to try different mouse positions or look for less obvious UI elements
- Maybe I should try going to a different section of the app first
- Maybe there's a keyboard shortcut

Let me try hovering over the calendar names to see if any options appear, or try some other interface elements I haven't explored yet.

action:
hover(bid="137")

2025-05-29 09:01:47,379 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I've been trying various approaches to find calendar color settings but haven't been successful yet. Let me think about what I've tried:

1. Clicked on calendar checkboxes - just toggles visibility
2. Right-clicked on calendar names and checkboxes - no context menu
3. Tried clicking on settings/gear icons - didn't work
4. Tried navigating to different URLs - didn't exist
5. Tried hovering over calendar names - no menu appeared
6. Tried accessing through event editing - no calendar color options there

I need to think of other approaches. Maybe the calendar color settings are accessed through a different method. Let me try:

1. Maybe there are hidden buttons or options I'm missing
2. Maybe I need to double-click on the calendar name itself
3. Maybe there's a different navigation approach
4. Maybe I need to look for a different UI element

Let me take a screenshot first to see the current visual state and look for any options I might have missed.

2025-05-29 09:01:58,753 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at this screenshot, I can see the calendar interface clearly now. In the left sidebar under "My calendars", I can see:

1. **Work** - with a cyan/turquoise colored checkbox (needs to change to peacock)
2. **Family** - with an orange/red colored checkbox  
3. **Personal** - with a purple/blue colored checkbox (needs to change to sage)

I can also see there are three dots (⋯) next to the "Work" calendar. This is likely the options menu for calendar settings. I should click on that to see if it opens a menu with color options.

I need to assign:
- Sage color to Personal calendar
- Peacock color to Work calendar

Let me try clicking on the three dots next to "Work".

1. **Work** - with a checkbox (needs to change to peacock color)
2. **Family** - with a checkbox  
3. **Personal** - with a checkbox (needs to change to sage color)

I can see the events are color-coded on the calendar. I've tried various approaches to access calendar color settings but haven't found the right way yet. Let me think about this differently.

I notice that the calendar interface appears to be a Google Calendar-like interface. In most calendar applications, there are usually settings accessible through:
1. Right-clicking on calendar names
2. Settings/gear icons
3. Calendar management pages
4. Dropdown menus next to calendar names

I've tried several of these approaches but haven't been successful. Let me try a few more approaches:

1. Try looking for a settings or preferences page through direct URL navigation
2. Try clicking on individual calendar text/names differently
3. Try looking for a calendar management interface

Given that this is a calendar color assignment task, there must be a way to change calendar colors. Let me try navigating to a potential settings or preferences page directly.

action:
goto(url="https://evals-gocalendar.vercel.app/preferences")

Since I've tried multiple approaches and haven't found the traditional calendar color settings interface, let me think about what I might be missing:

1. I've tried right-clicking on calendar names
2. I've tried clicking on colored checkboxes
3. I've tried three-dot menus
4. I've tried settings URLs
5. I've tried hovering over elements

Maybe I need to think differently about this task. Perhaps the calendar color assignment isn't done through traditional settings, but through some other interface. Let me go back to the calendar page and try to see if there are any other visual cues I'm missing.

Actually, let me take a systematic approach. I need to go back to the calendar page first.

4. Navigating to settings URLs - 404 errors
5. Clicking on settings gear icons - couldn't find the right element
6. Accessing through event editing - doesn't provide calendar color options

Let me think about this differently. Maybe the calendar color settings are built into the system and I need to find another approach. Let me try to look for any other interface elements I might have missed. 

Looking at the current state, I can see the notification alert is back. Let me close it first and then take a screenshot to see if I've missed any visual elements.

I can see the events are color-coded on the calendar. Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state clearly and look for any calendar color settings options I might have missed.

I need to find a way to access calendar color settings. So far I've tried:
- Right-clicking on calendar names
- Clicking on colored checkboxes

5. Trying different URLs
6. Clicking on events
7. Looking for gear icons

None of these have given me access to calendar color settings. Let me think about what I might be missing.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see:
- Work calendar has a cyan/turquoise color
- Family calendar has an orange/red color
- Personal calendar has a purple/blue color

The events on the calendar are color-coded to match these calendar colors.

Maybe the calendar color settings are accessible through a different interface element. Let me try a few more approaches:

1. Maybe there's a hamburger menu or settings in the top toolbar
2. Maybe I need to double-click on the calendar names
3. Maybe there's a dropdown arrow next to "My calendars" that provides settings
4. Maybe I need to try a different URL pattern

1. Work - with checkbox [135]
2. Family - with checkbox [143]  
3. Personal - with checkbox [152]

I can see events on the calendar that are color-coded. The goal is to assign:
- Sage color code to the "Personal" calendar
- Peacock color code to the "Work" calendar

I've been trying different approaches but haven't found the calendar color settings yet. Let me try a completely different approach. Maybe I need to look for calendar settings in a different way.

7. Trying to access settings through gear icons - couldn't find working gear icon

Looking at the screenshot again, I can see there's a small dropdown arrow next to "My calendars". Let me check if I can click on that arrow to expand calendar options.

Actually, looking more carefully at the screenshot, I notice there might be a settings/gear icon in the top right corner of the page. Let me try clicking on that area again.

I also notice that the calendar interface looks like a modern web application. Sometimes in calendar applications, you need to go into a specific settings or preferences area to change calendar colors. Let me try navigating to potential settings URLs again.

Let me try clicking on the settings/gear icon that I can see in the top right corner of the interface.

The only change I see is that the "Week" dropdown is no longer focused. This suggests that maybe the settings icon click didn't work as expected.

Let me try a different approach. I've been trying various methods to access calendar color settings but haven't been successful yet. Let me think about other possible approaches:

1. I've tried clicking on the colored checkboxes - they just toggle visibility
2. I've tried right-clicking - no context menus
3. I've tried the three dots next to calendars - they change the view
4. I've tried navigating to different URLs - they don't exist
5. I've tried the settings gear icon - it doesn't seem to open settings

Let me try looking for any other interface elements I might have missed. Maybe there's a different way to access calendar settings. 

Looking at the screenshot again, I notice:
- The calendars have colored checkboxes next to them
- There are three dots (⋯) next to some calendar names
- There's a hamburger menu icon (≡) in the top left
- There's a settings gear icon in the top right

Let me try some other approaches:
1. Maybe right-clicking directly on the colored checkbox
2. Maybe double-clicking on the calendar names
3. Maybe trying to navigate to a settings URL
4. Maybe clicking on an event and seeing if there are calendar color options there

I notice the state shows a "Toggle sidebar" button that's focused. Let me try exploring more interface elements.

Actually, let me step back and think - maybe the calendar colors are configured through a different interface entirely. Let me try some more systematic exploration.

Let me try right-clicking on the colored checkbox specifically, or maybe try clicking on the "Other calendars" section to see if that reveals options.

I've tried:

2. Right-clicking on calendar names and checkboxes (no context menu)
3. Clicking on the settings gear icon (no menu opens)
4. Clicking on the hamburger menu (just focuses the toggle sidebar button)
5. Trying different URL paths (/settings, /preferences, /calendar/config, /calendar/calendars) - none exist
6. Clicking on the three dots next to calendar names (changes view instead)
7. Going through event editing interface (no calendar color options there)

At this point, I've exhausted many typical approaches for accessing calendar color settings. Let me try one more approach - maybe there's a specific URL for calendar settings or maybe I need to look for a different interface element.

Let me try navigating to a settings page that might exist for this specific calendar application. Sometimes calendar apps have settings at /admin or /manage.

action:
goto(url="https://evals-gocalendar.vercel.app/admin")

2025-05-29 09:05:22,277 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 09:05:22,319 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The admin URL doesn't exist. Let me go back to the main calendar page and try a different approach. I've been trying to access calendar color settings through various methods but haven't found the right way yet. Let me go back to the calendar and try a different approach.

Looking at what I've tried so far:
1. Clicking on calendar checkboxes - just toggles visibility
2. Right-clicking on calendar names and checkboxes - no context menus
3. Clicking on three dots next to calendars - changes view
4. Clicking settings gear icon - doesn't open settings
5. Clicking hamburger menu - just focuses sidebar toggle
6. Trying various URLs - don't exist

Let me go back to the calendar page and try a completely different approach. Maybe the color settings are accessible through a different method that I haven't tried yet.

action:
goto(url="https://evals-gocalendar.vercel.app/calendar")

1. Work calendar (checkbox bid 135)
2. Family calendar (checkbox bid 143) 
3. Personal calendar (checkbox bid 152)

I need to assign:
- Sage color code to the "Personal" calendar
- Peacock color code to the "Work" calendar

I've tried many approaches so far but haven't found the calendar color settings yet. Let me think about what approaches I haven't tried:

1. I tried clicking on colored checkboxes - that just toggles visibility
2. I tried right-clicking - no context menus 
3. I tried clicking on calendar names - no options
4. I tried the three dots next to calendars - that just changes view
5. I tried navigating to settings URLs - they don't exist
6. I tried clicking on events and editing them - no calendar color settings there
7. I tried hamburger menu - no menu
8. I tried gear icon - no menu

I need to think more creatively. Maybe the color settings are accessible through:
- Double-clicking on the colored checkboxes
- Hovering over elements to reveal hidden options
- Clicking on specific elements I haven't tried yet
- The calendar color might be set through CSS or some other method

Let me first close the notification alert, then take a screenshot to see the visual state clearly.

action:
click(bid="52")

I've tried many approaches so far:
1. Clicking on calendar names
2. Right-clicking on calendar names

5. Trying to access settings menus
6. Trying different URLs like /settings, /admin, /preferences, /config, /calendars
7. Clicking on three dots icons
8. Clicking on hamburger menus
9. Clicking on gear icons
10. Trying to access through event creation/editing

None of these approaches have worked. The interface seems to only offer visibility toggles for calendars, not color customization.

Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state and think of any other approaches I might have missed.

1. **Work** - with a cyan/turquoise colored checkbox (needs to change to peacock)
2. **Family** - with an orange/red colored checkbox  
3. **Personal** - with a purple/blue colored checkbox (needs to change to sage)

I can see the events are color-coded on the calendar. Looking at the screenshot, I notice that in this interface design, it looks very much like Google Calendar. In Google Calendar, you can typically access calendar color settings by right-clicking on the calendar name or by accessing a settings menu.

Let me try a few more approaches:
1. Try right-clicking on the calendar names in the sidebar
2. Try looking for a settings gear icon
3. Try accessing calendar settings through a different URL path

I've already tried several approaches, but let me think about what I might have missed. Looking at the screenshot again, I can see there's a dropdown arrow next to "My calendars" and there are also some icons in the top right. I can also see there's a settings/gear icon in the top toolbar.

Let me try right-clicking on the actual calendar name text to see if there's a context menu.

5. I've tried clicking on event options and edit event - doesn't provide calendar color settings
6. I've tried clicking on the three dots next to calendars - but those seem to change the view instead

Let me try a different approach. Maybe I need to look for a different UI element. Let me try clicking on the hamburger menu or exploring other parts of the interface.

Actually, let me think about this differently. In many calendar applications, color settings might be accessible through:
1. A dropdown arrow next to "My calendars"
2. A different settings page
3. Through individual calendar management

Let me try clicking on the dropdown arrow next to "My calendars" section to see if it provides calendar management options.

I can see the events are color-coded on the calendar. I've tried many approaches to find calendar color settings:

1. Clicking on the colored checkboxes - this just toggles visibility
2. Right-clicking on calendar names - no context menu
3. Clicking on three dots - this changes view to single day

6. Clicking on event options - only shows event editing
7. Clicking hamburger menu - just focuses toggle button
8. Clicking dropdown arrow next to "My calendars" - changes to single day view

I haven't been able to find any interface for changing calendar colors. Let me try one more approach - maybe I need to inspect the colored checkboxes more carefully. Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state clearly and see if there are any visual clues I might have missed.

5. Trying different URLs like /settings, /admin, /preferences - all 404
6. Clicking through event editing - no calendar color options
7. Clicking on dropdown arrows - changes view instead of settings

I need to try a different approach. Let me think about what other options I have:

1. Maybe there's a settings menu I haven't found yet
2. Maybe the color settings are accessible through a different interface element
3. Maybe I need to look for other icons or buttons

Looking at the screenshot more carefully, I can see there's a settings/gear icon in the top right corner. I've tried clicking on it before but maybe I need to try clicking on it more precisely using mouse coordinates.

Let me also check if there are any other interface elements I might have missed. I can see:
- Hamburger menu (three lines) on the left
- GoCalendar logo and text
- Today button
- Previous/next navigation arrows


- Week dropdown currently selected
- Apps icon
- User profile image
- Settings gear icon

I'll focus on the settings gear icon, attempting to click it with more precise mouse coordinates to see if I can access the color settings.

Let me think of other approaches:
1. Maybe I need to access settings through the user profile menu
2. Maybe there's a calendar management page through a different URL
3. Maybe I need to look for a different settings icon or menu

The hamburger menu just focused the "Toggle sidebar" button but didn't open any menu. I need to think of other approaches.

Looking at the current state, I can see:
- Work calendar with cyan/turquoise color (needs to change to peacock)
- Family calendar with orange/red color
- Personal calendar with purple/blue color (needs to change to sage)

I wonder if there might be a specific calendar management page or if the color settings are hidden in some other interface element. Let me try some more exploratory approaches.

Maybe I should try:
1. Double-clicking on calendar names
2. Looking for more URL patterns
3. Checking if there are any other clickable elements in the interface
4. Trying keyboard shortcuts

I notice I've been focusing on trying to find settings menus, but maybe the color assignment works differently in this calendar application. Let me try a different approach - maybe there's a way to directly modify calendar colors through a different interface.

Let me try checking if there's a way to create or manage calendars through the "Other calendars" section or see if the "+" button there provides access to calendar management.

1. **Work** - has a cyan/turquoise checkbox/color indicator (currently showing cyan events on the calendar)
2. **Family** - has an orange/red checkbox/color indicator (currently showing orange events on the calendar)  
3. **Personal** - has a purple/blue checkbox/color indicator (currently showing purple events on the calendar)

I need to change:
- Work calendar to peacock color
- Personal calendar to sage color

I can see the events are color-coded on the calendar based on their calendar assignment. Looking at the events:
- Work events (like "Team Standup Meeting", "Project Sync", "Team Check-In", etc.) are showing in cyan/turquoise
- Family events (like "Morning Coffee with sister") are showing in orange/red
- Personal events (like "Morning Walk") are showing in purple

I need to find a way to change these calendar colors. Looking at the screenshot, I can see there are checkboxes next to each calendar name in the sidebar. Let me try right-clicking on these or see if there are any other menu options.

I notice there's a settings gear icon in the top right corner of the interface. Let me try clicking on that to see if it provides access to calendar color settings.

Actually, let me try a different approach. Sometimes in calendar applications, you can access calendar settings by right-clicking on the calendar name or checkbox in the sidebar. Let me try that approach.

2025-05-29 09:09:42,049 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to assign color codes to the calendars - sage for "Personal" and peacock for "Work". Looking at the current screenshot, I can see:

1. Work calendar - currently cyan/turquoise color (needs to change to peacock)
2. Family calendar - currently orange/red color 
3. Personal calendar - currently purple/blue color (needs to change to sage)

I've been trying various approaches to find calendar color settings:
- Clicking on the colored checkboxes (just toggles visibility)
- Right-clicking on calendar names (no context menu)
- Looking for settings gear icons (can't find the right element)
- Trying different URLs (/settings, /preferences, /admin, /config - all 404)
- Clicking on hamburger menus, user profiles, etc.

None of these approaches have worked. Let me think of other possibilities:

1. Maybe I need to click directly on the calendar name text rather than the checkbox
2. Maybe there's a different way to access settings through events
3. Maybe the color settings are accessed through a different interface element I haven't tried
4. Maybe I need to hover over elements to reveal options
5. Maybe there are keyboard shortcuts or other methods

Looking at the screenshot, I can see in the left sidebar there are checkboxes next to each calendar name, but I haven't tried right-clicking directly on the colored checkbox itself. Let me try that.

Actually, wait - let me look more carefully at the screenshot. I can see there's a settings gear icon in the top right corner. Let me try clicking on it using mouse coordinates.

action:
mouse_click(x=1045, y=31)

2025-05-29 09:09:57,435 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The click on the settings gear icon didn't seem to produce any visible changes in the page state. This suggests that either the settings icon doesn't work or there isn't a global settings menu for calendar colors.

Let me think about different approaches I could try:

1. I've already tried right-clicking on calendar names and colored checkboxes
2. I've tried clicking on the three dots next to calendars (but that changed views instead)
3. I've tried various URL paths for settings
4. I've tried the settings gear icon
5. I've tried the hamburger menu
6. I've tried the user profile image

Looking at the screenshot more carefully, I can see that each calendar has a colored checkbox next to it in the sidebar:
- Work has a cyan/blue checkbox
- Family has an orange checkbox  
- Personal has a purple checkbox

Maybe the color settings are accessible through a different method. Let me try:
1. Right-clicking directly on the colored checkbox itself
2. Hovering over the colored checkbox to see if there are options
3. Double-clicking on the colored checkbox
4. Looking for a different interface element I might have missed

Actually, let me try navigating to different potential settings URLs that might exist for this calendar application.

1. Tried clicking on colored checkboxes
2. Tried clicking on calendar names
3. Tried right-clicking on various elements
4. Tried clicking on settings gear icon
5. Tried navigating to different URLs like /settings, /preferences, /admin, /config
6. Tried clicking on event edit interface
7. Tried hamburger menu
8. Tried user profile
9. Tried apps button
10. Tried dropdown arrows

None of these approaches have revealed calendar color settings. Let me think about this differently. Maybe the calendar color settings are accessed through a different mechanism entirely. 

Let me try exploring more systematically. I should try:
1. Hovering over different elements to see if tooltips or menus appear
2. Looking for any three-dot menus or options menus I might have missed
3. Trying to access calendar settings through a specific event or calendar management page

Actually, let me try a completely different approach. Maybe I need to access calendar settings through the "Other calendars" section or through a different interface element. Let me try clicking on the "+" button next to "Other calendars" to see if it provides access to calendar management features.

I've tried:
- Clicking settings gear icon 
- Right-clicking on calendar names and checkboxes

None of these approaches have worked so far. Let me try a completely different approach. Maybe the calendar color configuration is available through an event editing interface or through a different part of the UI.

Actually, let me step back and think about this. Maybe there's a way to access calendar settings through the calendar interface that I haven't tried yet. 

Looking at the current page state, I can see there are calendar checkboxes with IDs 135, 143, and 152 for Work, Family, and Personal respectively. Let me try double-clicking on one of the calendar names to see if that opens settings.

action:

This suggests that the standard UI interactions aren't working for accessing calendar color settings.

Let me think about this differently. I've tried:
1. Right-clicking on calendar names and checkboxes
2. Clicking on settings gear icon
3. Clicking on various UI elements
4. Navigating to different URLs like /settings, /admin, /preferences, /config
5. Double-clicking on calendar names
6. Hovering over elements
7. Clicking on hamburger menu
8. Clicking on user profile
9. Clicking on apps icon
10. Clicking on various dropdown arrows

None of these approaches have worked to access calendar color settings. This might indicate that:
1. The calendar color settings are not accessible through the UI I'm seeing
2. The calendar colors might be hardcoded or not configurable
3. There might be a different way to access these settings that I haven't discovered

Since I've exhausted most UI interaction possibilities, let me try a few more approaches:
1. Check if there are any hidden or less obvious interface elements
2. Try a completely different URL structure for calendar management
3. Check if there are any right-click context menus I might have missed
4. See if there are keyboard shortcuts that might open settings

Let me take a screenshot first to see the current state and then try some other approaches.

I need to change Work to peacock color and Personal to sage color. I can see there are three dots (⋯) next to each calendar in the sidebar. This is likely the options menu for calendar settings. Let me try clicking on the three dots next to "Work" to see if it opens a menu with color options.

Wait, I can see in the screenshot that there are indeed three dots next to "Work" calendar. Let me try clicking on those three dots to access the calendar options menu.

2025-05-29 09:11:10,992 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I see that clicking on the three dots changed the view to a single day view (Thursday Jul 18) instead of opening calendar settings. This isn't what I need for calendar color settings. I've tried many different approaches to access calendar color settings:

1. Right-clicking on calendar names
2. Right-clicking on colored checkboxes
3. Clicking on settings gear icon
4. Clicking on hamburger menu
5. Double-clicking on calendar names
6. Clicking on the three dots next to calendars
7. Trying different URLs for settings pages
8. Clicking on various interface elements

None of these approaches have provided access to calendar color settings. The calendar application seems to be a read-only demonstration or the color settings functionality may not be implemented in this interface.

However, I need to carefully read the goal again: "Assign a sage color code to the "Personal" calendar and a peacock color code to the "Work" calendar"

The goal is to assign color codes, but I haven't been able to find any interface for changing calendar colors. This could mean:
1. The functionality doesn't exist in this calendar application
2. The color settings are accessed through a different method I haven't discovered
3. The calendar colors are pre-configured and cannot be changed

Let me go back to the multi-day view first and take another screenshot to see if I missed anything.

1. **Work** - with a checkbox (currently checked, showing cyan/turquoise events)
2. **Family** - with a checkbox (currently checked, showing orange/red events)  
3. **Personal** - with a checkbox (currently checked, showing purple/blue events)

I need to change the Work calendar to peacock color and Personal calendar to sage color. However, I've tried many different approaches to find calendar color settings and haven't been successful:

- Clicking on the colored checkboxes just toggles visibility
- Right-clicking doesn't show context menus
- The three dots next to calendars just change the view
- Settings gear icon doesn't open any menu
- Various URL paths for settings don't exist
- Double-clicking doesn't work
- Hamburger menu doesn't open settings
- Plus button for other calendars doesn't work

It seems like this calendar application might not have the capability to change calendar colors, or the feature might be hidden or not implemented yet. 

However, let me try one more approach. Let me examine the current state more carefully. Looking at the current interface, I can see:

1. **Work** - checkbox with ID 135
2. **Family** - checkbox with ID 143  
3. **Personal** - checkbox with ID 152

Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state and check if the calendar colors have actually changed already. Maybe the task has been completed automatically or the colors are already correct.

2025-05-29 09:11:57,076 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Now I can see the calendar interface clearly. Looking at the screenshot, I can see:

In the left sidebar under "My calendars":
1. **Work** - with a cyan/turquoise colored checkbox (currently showing cyan events on the calendar like "Team Standup Meeting", "Client Call", "Project Sync", "Breakfast Meeting with Client", "Team Progress Check")
2. **Family** - with an orange/red colored checkbox (currently showing orange/red events on the calendar like "Morning Coffee with sister", "Customer")
3. **Personal** - with a purple/blue colored checkbox (currently showing purple events on the calendar like "Morning Walk", "Team Check-In")

I need to change:
- Work calendar to peacock color 
- Personal calendar to sage color

Looking at the current colors:
- Work is currently cyan/turquoise - this already looks quite close to peacock! Peacock is typically a blue-green/teal color, and the current cyan/turquoise is very similar to peacock.
- Personal is currently purple/blue - this needs to change to sage. Sage is typically a grayish-green color.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. Looking at the colors:

1. Work calendar shows cyan/turquoise events on the calendar - this is actually quite close to peacock color already! Peacock is a blue-green/teal color, which is very similar to the current cyan.

2. Personal calendar shows purple/blue events - this needs to change to sage (grayish-green).

But I still haven't found a way to change the calendar colors! I've tried:
- Right-clicking on calendar names
- Right-clicking on colored checkboxes  
- Clicking on settings gear icon
- Clicking on three dots next to calendar names
- Trying different URL paths
- Looking for menu options

None of these approaches have worked to access calendar color settings. Let me try one more approach - maybe the color settings are available through event creation or editing. 

I'll investigate the event creation process to see if I can uncover the color modification method. Perhaps the color settings are hidden within the event details or creation workflow.

Let me check what's available in this event creation dialog. I see:
- Title textbox
- Date/time settings
- "Edit calendar details" button - this might give me access to calendar configuration
- "More options" button - this could also provide calendar color settings

I should click on "Edit calendar details" or "More options" to see if I can access calendar color configuration from here.

Let me try "More options" first as that seems like the most likely place to find calendar color settings.
