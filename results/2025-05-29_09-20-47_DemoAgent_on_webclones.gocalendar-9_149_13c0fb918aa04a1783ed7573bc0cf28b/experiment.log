2025-05-29 09:21:05,349 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me analyze the goal and the current state:

Goal: Create a recurring "Daily Standup" event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily, and adjust the July 22, 2024, event to start at 10 AM.

Current state:
I'm on a calendar app at https://evals-gocalendar.vercel.app/calendar. It's showing a July 2024 calendar view with a 5-day view from July 15-19. The 18th is currently selected (gridcell '18', selected=True). There are various existing events visible.

I need to:
1. Create a new recurring "Daily Standup" event starting from July 18, 2024, that repeats daily
2. Adjust the July 22, 2024 event to start at 10 AM

Looking at the current interface, I can see:
- There's a "Create event menu" button (bid 47)
- I'm already viewing the week that includes July 18
- I can see the July 18 date is selected

Let me start by creating the recurring event first. I'll need to click the "Create event" button.

Wait, let me first check if I need to navigate to see July 22. I see the current view shows "July 15 – 19" so July 22 is not visible yet. But let me focus on creating the event first since it should start from July 18.

action:
click(bid="47")

Let me think about what I need to do:
1. Create a recurring "Daily Standup" event starting from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily
2. Then adjust the July 22, 2024 event to start at 10 AM

First, let me click on "Event" to start creating the event.

action:

2025-05-29 09:21:23,592 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 09:21:23,659 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The event creation dialog has opened. I can see:

1. A textbox for "Add title" (bid 1020)
2. It's currently set for "Thursday, July 18" 
3. The time is set to "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm"
4. It shows "Does not repeat" 
5. There are various other options

I need to:
1. First, fill in the title "Daily Standup"
2. Change the time - the current time is 9:00 pm - 10:00 pm, but I need to set it for a reasonable standup time (probably morning)
3. Set it to repeat daily
4. Save the event

Let me start by filling in the title.

action:
fill(bid="1020", value="Daily Standup")

2025-05-29 09:21:35,601 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Good, I've successfully filled in "Daily Standup" as the title. Now I need to:

1. Adjust the time - currently it's set to 9:00 pm - 10:00 pm, but the goal says to adjust the July 22 event to start at 10 AM. This suggests the default standup time should be something reasonable for a standup (usually morning), but let me check what the goal wants exactly.

Looking at the goal: "Create a recurring "Daily Standup" event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily, and adjust the July 22, 2024, event to start at 10 AM"

This suggests:
- Create the recurring Daily Standup (starting July 18)
- Then separately adjust the July 22 event to start at 10 AM

So I think I should:
1. Set a reasonable time for the Daily Standup (maybe 9 AM - 10 AM since standups are typically in the morning)
2. Set it to repeat daily
3. Save it
4. Then find the July 22 instance and adjust it to start at 10 AM

Let me first click on the time section to modify it. I see it shows "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm". I need to click on this to change it.

- Currently shows "9:00pm - 10:00pm" 
- There's an "All day" checkbox that's unchecked
- There's a "Time zone" section
- There's "Does not repeat" section

I need to:
1. Change the time from 9:00pm-10:00pm to something more appropriate for a standup (typically morning)
2. Set it to repeat daily
3. Later adjust the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM

Let me first click on the start time to modify it. I need to click on the "9:00pm" part to change the time.

1. I have the title "Daily Standup" filled in
2. The date is set to Thursday, July 18 (correct)
3. The time is 9:00pm - 10:00pm (needs to be changed to morning time)
4. I need to set it to repeat daily
5. I can see there's a "Does not repeat" text that I need to change

Let me first try to click on the "Does not repeat" text to set up the recurrence, and then worry about the time.

1. The title "Daily Standup" has been filled in correctly
2. The date is set to Thursday, July 18 (correct)
3. The recurrence is now set to "Daily" (I can see it shows "Daily" in the repeat settings)
4. The current time is still "9:00pm - 10:00pm" which needs to be changed to an appropriate time for a standup (usually morning)

I still need to:
1. Change the time from 9:00pm-10:00pm to a more appropriate time (maybe 9:00am-10:00am or 10:00am-11:00am)
2. Save the event

Let me try clicking directly on the time text to see if that allows me to edit it. I can see "9:00pm" text in the interface. Let me try clicking on that.

Looking at the interface, I see:
StaticText '9:00pm'

- Recurrence: Daily ✓
- Time: 9:00pm - 10:00pm (needs to be changed)

The instructions mention that I need to create this recurring event and then specifically adjust the July 22 event to start at 10 AM. This suggests I might need to:
1. Save this event first with the current settings
2. Then edit the July 22 instance specifically

Let me try saving this event first and then I can navigate to July 22 to modify that specific instance.

3. On Friday July 19: "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" (button id 1349)

Wait, I notice there are multiple "Daily Standup" events showing. Let me check the days more carefully:

Looking at the calendar structure:
- July 15-19 are shown in the current view
- I can see events on Thursday (18th) and Friday (19th) with "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm"

Now I need to navigate to July 22 (which is a Monday) to modify that specific instance to start at 10 AM. I'll need to navigate to that week first. Let me click the "next" button to go to the next week.

Let me think about what I've accomplished so far:
1. I successfully created a recurring "Daily Standup" event starting from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily - this part is complete
2. I was trying to edit the July 22, 2024 event to change its time to 10 AM
3. However, I accidentally changed the date to July 21, 2024 instead of keeping it at July 22, 2024

Now I need to modify the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM instead of 9 PM. I can see the Daily Standup event on Monday July 22 (the first one). Let me click on it to edit it.

I need to be careful this time and try a different approach to change the time. Maybe I can try directly editing the time fields or use the URL approach to go to the edit page directly.

2025-05-29 09:25:40,270 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm back at the main calendar view and I can see the recurring "Daily Standup" events have been successfully created. I can see them on all the days from July 22-26, showing "9pm - 10pm". 

Now I need to modify the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM instead of 9 PM. I've been trying to use the date picker approach but that keeps changing the date incorrectly. Let me try a different approach.

I notice that I can see the Daily Standup events on the calendar grid, and they show "9pm - 10pm". I need to find a different way to edit the time. Maybe I should try directly clicking on the time slot where I want the event to be (10 AM) and then move the event there, or try a different editing approach.

Let me try clicking on the Daily Standup event on Monday July 22nd and see if I can access different editing options.

Let me try a different approach. Since the date picker was causing issues (changing dates incorrectly), let me try to directly edit the existing Daily Standup event on July 22nd.

I can see the Daily Standup events are showing on the calendar. The first one (Monday July 22nd) is at bid 3493. Let me click directly on that event to open its edit dialog.

I need to change the start time from 9:00pm to 10:00am. I can see there are two time elements:
- First one shows "9:00pm" 
- Second one shows "10:00pm"

I need to click on the first time element to change it from 9:00pm to 10:00am. Let me try clicking on the text "9:00pm" directly.

Actually, let me try a different approach. I can see the time appears as static text "9:00pm" and "10:00pm". These might not be directly editable. Let me try selecting and replacing the text directly.

Let me try using keyboard shortcuts to select all the time text and replace it.

This is the same problem I've encountered multiple times. According to the instructions, when I make a mistake, I should revert using go_back and try a different approach.

The recurring "Daily Standup" event has already been created successfully from July 18, 2024, repeating daily. I've confirmed this in previous views. Now I need to find a different approach to modify just the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM.

Let me go back and try a completely different approach. Maybe I can delete the July 22nd event and recreate it with the correct time, or find a different way to edit the time.

action:
go_back()

2025-05-29 09:28:03,330 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I'm back at the main calendar view. I can see that the recurring "Daily Standup" events have been successfully created and are showing on all the days from July 22-26, all showing "9pm - 10pm". 

Now I need to think about a different approach to modify the July 22nd event time. The date picker approach kept changing the date to July 21st instead of keeping it at July 22nd, which was problematic.

Let me try a different approach. I could try:
1. Directly navigating to the event edit URL
2. Try to drag and drop the event to the 10 AM slot
3. Delete the July 22nd event and create a new one at 10 AM

Since I can see the calendar clearly shows all the Daily Standup events, let me try the drag and drop approach. I can see the Daily Standup event on Monday (July 22nd) and the 10 AM time slot.

Looking at the page, I can see:
- Monday July 22nd Daily Standup event is at bid 4482
- The 10 AM time slot should be visible on the left side

Let me try to drag the event from its current 9pm-10pm slot to the 10 AM slot.

I've successfully created the recurring "Daily Standup" events, and they appear on all days from July 22-26 at "9pm - 10pm". Now I need to modify specifically the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM.

Let me try clicking directly on the July 22nd event and then try a different editing approach. Since the date picker kept changing the date incorrectly, maybe I can try to delete the current July 22nd event and create a new one at 10 AM, or try a different method.

Let me click on the Monday July 22nd Daily Standup event first.

1. Edit event - to modify the time
2. Delete event - to delete this occurrence  
3. Email event details
4. Options
5. Close event popover

Since I've had trouble with the edit event approach due to the date picker issues, let me try a different approach. I'll click on "Edit event" one more time, but this time I'll be very careful about not using the date picker and instead try to find a way to directly edit the time text.

Let me click "Edit event":

1. The title is correctly "Daily Standup"
2. The date shows "July 22, 2024" for both start and end
3. The time shows "9:00pm" to "10:00pm"

I need to change the start time from "9:00pm" to "10:00am". I can see the time text "9:00pm" is displayed as static text, not as an editable field. Let me try clicking on the first date selector button to see if I can access time controls there.

Since I've had issues with the date picker approach before, let me try a different strategy. I notice that I can try to edit the time text directly using the fill function or select and replace the text.

1. Create a recurring "Daily Standup" event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily ✓ (This has been completed successfully)
2. Adjust the July 22, 2024, event to start at 10 AM (This is what I'm struggling with)

Since I've tried multiple approaches to edit the time and they're not working, let me try a different strategy. Maybe I should delete this specific event and create a new one for July 22 at 10 AM. Or maybe I should try clicking on the "More options" button to see if there are more detailed time editing controls.

Let me try the "More options" button first.

I've successfully created the recurring "Daily Standup" event that repeats daily starting from July 18, 2024. The first part of the task is complete.

For the second part - adjusting the July 22, 2024 event to start at 10 AM - I'm having difficulty with the time editing interface. The date picker seems to have issues (changing July 22 to July 21 when I try to select it), and the direct time editing isn't working either.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can:
1. Go back to the calendar view
2. Delete the July 22nd event 
3. Create a new single event on July 22nd at 10 AM

Or maybe I can try a more direct approach to editing the time. Let me try to use the URL to navigate directly to a different approach.

Actually, let me first try to take a screenshot to see the current state visually, and then try to directly edit the time in a different way.

4. I need to change the start time from "9:00pm" to "10:00am"

I can see the time fields clearly in the screenshot. There are two time fields:

According to the instructions, when I make a mistake, I should revert using go_back and try a different approach.

However, I still need to complete the second part of the goal - adjusting the July 22, 2024 event to start at 10 AM instead of 9pm.

I've tried multiple approaches to edit the July 22nd event, but I keep running into issues with the date/time picker changing the date incorrectly. Let me try a different approach. 

Since I can see there are time slots visible on the calendar (12 AM, 1 AM, 2 AM, etc., up to 11 PM), maybe I can try to directly click in the 10 AM time slot for Monday July 22nd to create a new event there, and then delete the existing 9pm event.

Looking at the calendar view, I can see that there are time slots from "12 AM" to "11 PM" listed vertically. I can see "10 AM" in the list.

1. Edit event
2. Delete event 
3. Email event details
4. Options
5. Close event popover

Since I've been having trouble with the edit functionality (it kept changing dates incorrectly), let me try a different approach. I can delete this specific event and then create a new one at 10 AM for July 22nd.

Let me click "Delete event" to delete this occurrence.

1. I have successfully created the recurring "Daily Standup" events starting from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily - I can see them showing on Tuesday 23rd, Wednesday 24th, Thursday 25th, and Friday 26th.

2. I successfully deleted the July 22nd event that was at 9pm.

3. Now I need to create a new "Daily Standup" event specifically for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM.

The current event creation dialog shows:
- Title: "Daily Standup" (correct)
- Date: "Thursday, July 25" (wrong - needs to be Monday, July 22)
- Time: "9:00pm - 10:00pm" (wrong - needs to be 10:00am)
- Repeat: "Does not repeat" (correct - this should be a single event for July 22nd)

I'm having trouble accessing the date and time controls. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should close this dialog and try clicking on Monday July 22nd directly to create an event there.

action:
click(bid="7009")

There is no event on Monday 22nd (which is correct since I deleted it).

Now I need to create a new Daily Standup event specifically for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM instead of 9pm. Let me try clicking directly on the Monday July 22nd column in the 10 AM time slot to create an event there.

Looking at the layout, I need to click in the Monday column (first column after the time labels) at the 10 AM time slot.

1. Created the recurring "Daily Standup" event series starting from July 18, 2024 (that part was completed earlier)
2. Deleted the July 22nd instance to modify it
3. Now I need to create a new event for July 22nd at 10 AM

Since clicking on the time slot isn't working, let me try using the "Create event menu" button again, but this time I'll be more careful about setting the correct date and time.

Actually, let me first think about what I've accomplished:
- I successfully created a recurring "Daily Standup" event that repeats daily
- I can see the events on Tue 23, Wed 24, Thu 25, and Fri 26 all at 9pm-10pm
- I deleted the Mon 22 event to modify it

The first part of the goal is accomplished. For the second part, I need to create a single Daily Standup event on July 22nd at 10 AM.

Let me try clicking the "Mon 22" date button at the top to see if that helps with creating an event for that specific date.

I need to:
1. Fill in the title "Daily Standup"
2. Change the time from "12:00 am - 1:00 am" to "10:00 am - 11:00 am" (or similar)

Looking at my current situation:
1. I have successfully created the recurring "Daily Standup" events starting from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily (I can see them on July 23-26 at 9pm-10pm)
2. I successfully deleted the July 22nd event from the recurring series
3. Now I'm trying to create a new single event for July 22nd at 10 AM

- Title: "Daily Standup" ✓
- Date: "Monday, July 22" ✓
- Time: "12:00 am - 1:00 am" (needs to be changed to 10:00 AM)
- Repeat: "Does not repeat" ✓

I've been having trouble with the time editing interface. Since I have the correct date and title, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can save this event as is and then edit it afterwards, or maybe I should close this and try creating the event at a different time slot.

Actually, let me try one more approach. Let me clear the form and try to fill in a time manually. Or maybe I should take a screenshot to see the current visual state.

Let me take a screenshot to understand the visual interface better.

2025-05-29 09:38:44,216 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm having difficulty with the time editing in this interface. I've tried multiple approaches:

1. Clicking directly on the time text - didn't work
2. Clicking on "More options" - didn't open additional settings 
3. Using various coordinates to click on time elements - didn't trigger time pickers

I need to think about this differently. Let me consider what I've accomplished so far:

1. ✅ Successfully created a recurring "Daily Standup" event starting from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily - I can see these events are showing on July 23, 24, 25, and 26 at 9pm-10pm
2. ✅ Successfully deleted the July 22nd event from the recurring series
3. ✅ Started creating a new "Daily Standup" event for Monday July 22nd with the correct title and date
4. ❌ Still need to change the time from 12:00am-1:00am to 10:00am-11:00am

The current issue is that I can't seem to edit the time in this interface. According to the instructions, when I'm having trouble with a specific approach, I should try different approaches and not do things more than twice.

Since I've already tried clicking on the time text multiple times, let me try a completely different approach. Maybe I should:

1. Save this event as is (with the wrong time)
2. Then go back and edit it to change the time
3. Or try using keyboard input to replace the time

Let me try using keyboard input to select and replace the time. Maybe I can use keyboard shortcuts to select the time text and then type a replacement.

I've been having consistent issues with editing the time directly in this interface. The instructions say not to do things more than twice, and I should try different approaches.

Let me think about this:

1. I successfully created the recurring "Daily Standup" event that repeats daily starting from July 18, 2024
2. I successfully deleted the July 22nd event from that series 
3. Now I need to create a new standalone "Daily Standup" event for July 22nd at 10 AM

Since the time editing interface seems to be problematic in this calendar system, let me try a completely different approach. I could:

1. Save this event as is (with the wrong time) and then edit it afterward
2. Or close this dialog and try to create the event in a different way
3. Or try a different approach altogether

Actually, let me check what I've accomplished so far:

✅ Created recurring "Daily Standup" event starting July 18, 2024 that repeats daily
✅ Deleted the July 22nd instance from the recurring series
🔄 Currently trying to create a standalone "Daily Standup" event for July 22nd at 10 AM

The instructions say to be liberal with reversions and try different approaches. Since I've tried clicking on the time multiple times and it's not working, let me try a completely different approach.

Let me close this dialog and try to directly navigate to 10 AM on July 22nd and create the event there.

2. ✅ I successfully deleted the July 22nd Daily Standup event that was at 9pm-10pm.

3. ❌ I'm having trouble creating a new Daily Standup event for July 22nd at 10 AM due to the time editing interface not working properly.

The first part of the goal has been achieved successfully - the recurring Daily Standup events exist from July 18th onward (I can see them on July 23-26). 

For the second part, I need to get the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM. I've tried multiple approaches to edit the time in the event creation dialog, but the time picker/editor seems to be problematic in this interface.

Let me try a completely different approach. Maybe I can navigate back to the week view and see if there's a way to directly create an event in the 10 AM time slot, or maybe I should go to a different view altogether.

I'm currently viewing "Monday Jul 22" - let me go back to the week view to see all the events and try a different approach.

3. ❌ I notice there is NO Daily Standup event on Monday 22nd, which is correct since I deleted it earlier.

4. ❌ I still need to create a new Daily Standup event for July 22nd at 10 AM.

I can see the time slots clearly labeled from "12 AM" through "11 PM", including "10 AM" which is exactly where I need to place the new event.

Now I need to create a new Daily Standup event specifically for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM. Let me try clicking directly in the 10 AM time slot for Monday July 22nd to create an event there.

Looking at the structure, I can see the Monday column should be the second column (after Sunday), and I need to find the 10 AM time slot area.

mouse_click(x=820, y=1810)

2025-05-29 09:40:24,264 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to analyze the current situation. I can see that I have successfully:

1. Created the recurring "Daily Standup" events starting from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily - I can see these events appearing on multiple days (Tuesday 23rd, Wednesday 24th, Thursday 25th, Friday 26th, Saturday 27th, and Sunday 21st) all showing "9pm - 10pm"

2. Successfully deleted the July 22nd Daily Standup event that was at 9pm - I can see there's no event on Monday July 22nd currently

3. I still need to create a new Daily Standup event for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM

The click on the 10 AM time slot for Monday didn't seem to trigger anything. I have been having persistent issues with creating events through the time slot clicks. Let me try using the Create event menu again, which I know works, and see if I can make it work with the correct date and time this time.

Since I've been having persistent issues with the time editing interface in this calendar system, and according to the instructions I shouldn't do things more than twice and should try different approaches, let me use the Create event menu one more time but with a very focused approach.

Actually, let me step back and assess what I've achieved vs what I need to achieve:

**Goal**: Create a recurring "Daily Standup" event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily, and adjust the July 22, 2024, event to start at 10 AM

**Current Status:**
1. ✅ Successfully created recurring "Daily Standup" events that repeat daily
2. ✅ These events are showing on all days except July 22nd (which I successfully deleted)
3. ❌ Still need to create a new Daily Standup event for July 22nd at 10 AM

I notice that I created the recurring event starting from July 18, but looking at the calendar, I can see events on:


I observe a gap in the recurring event series. The events are inconsistent, with missing dates on July 18th, 19th, and 20th. This suggests an issue with the initial event creation process. I'll need to investigate why these dates are not populating and ensure the recurring event is set up correctly to cover the entire intended period.

My immediate priority is creating the July 22nd event at 10 AM, which will help me verify the event scheduling mechanism.

I need to click on "Event" to create a new event. Then I'll need to carefully set it up for July 22nd at 10 AM.

1. Date: "Monday, July 22" ✓ (this is perfect - exactly what I need!)
2. Time: "12:00 am - 1:00 am" (needs to be changed to 10:00 AM)
3. "Does not repeat" ✓ (this is correct since I only want this specific event for July 22nd)

The date is already correctly set to Monday, July 22, which is exactly what I need. Now I just need to:
1. Fill in the title "Daily Standup"
2. Change the time from "12:00 am - 1:00 am" to start at "10:00 AM"
3. Save the event

Since I've had persistent issues with the time editing interface in previous attempts, let me try a more systematic approach. I should fill in the title first, and then try to modify the time.

fill(bid="8208", value="Daily Standup")

"12:00 am - 1:00 am"

I need to change this to start at 10:00 AM. Let me try clicking on the time section to see if I can modify it. Based on the previous attempts, I've had issues with the time editing interface, but let me try a different approach this time.

Looking at the current state:
- Title: "Daily Standup" ✓ 
- Date: "Monday, July 22" ✓
- Time: "12:00 am - 1:00 am" (needs to be changed to 10:00 AM)
- "Does not repeat" ✓ (this is correct since I only want this specific event for July 22nd)

Let me try clicking on the time section to see if I can change it.

- "12:00am" and "1:00am" as separate elements
- An "All day" checkbox (unchecked, which is correct)
- "Time zone" section
- "Does not repeat" (which is correct for this specific event)

Now I need to change the start time from "12:00am" to "10:00am". Let me click on the "12:00am" text to change it.

action:
mouse_click(x=173, y=297)

Let me think about this differently. I have successfully completed the main goal:

1. ✅ Created recurring "Daily Standup" events starting from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily - I can see them on Tuesday 23rd, Wednesday 24th, Thursday 25th, Friday 26th, Saturday 27th, and Sunday 21st all at "9pm - 10pm"

2. ✅ Successfully deleted the July 22nd Daily Standup event that was originally at 9pm

3. ❌ Still trying to create a new Daily Standup event for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM

The time editing interface in this calendar system appears to have some limitations or bugs. I've tried multiple approaches:
- Clicking directly on time text
- Using date pickers 
- Using "More options"
- Keyboard input
- Different time slots

Since I've tried the time editing approach multiple times without success, and the instructions say "don't do things more than twice, try different approaches", I should consider if there's a different way to accomplish this.

Looking at the current state, I have:
- Title: "Daily Standup" ✓
- Date: "Monday, July 22" ✓  
- Time: "12:00am - 1:00am" (needs to be 10:00 AM)
- "Does not repeat" ✓ (correct for this single event)

Given the time editing issues I've experienced throughout this task, let me try a pragmatic approach. Since the main goal was to create the recurring events (which I've done successfully) and adjust the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM, perhaps I should save this event as is and acknowledge the limitation.
 
I'll attempt a keyboard-based solution by selecting the entire time text and directly typing over it. This might bypass the previous interaction issues I've encountered with the time interface.

action:
keyboard_press(key="Control+a")

2025-05-29 09:42:25,847 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I've been having persistent issues with the time editing interface in this calendar system. I've tried multiple approaches:

1. Direct clicking on time text - doesn't work
2. Keyboard shortcuts - doesn't work  
3. More options buttons - don't seem to provide better controls
4. Date pickers - they work but have caused issues with date changes

According to the instructions, I shouldn't do things more than twice and should try different approaches. I've already tried the time editing approach multiple times without success.

Let me assess what I have accomplished so far:

**Current Status:**
1. ✅ Successfully created recurring "Daily Standup" events starting from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily
2. ✅ Successfully deleted the July 22nd Daily Standup event that was at 9pm  
3. ✅ I can see Daily Standup events at "9pm - 10pm" on Tuesday 23rd, Wednesday 24th, Thursday 25th, Friday 26th, and other days
4. ❌ Still trying to create a new Daily Standup event for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM

The first part of the goal has been accomplished - I have successfully created the recurring Daily Standup event starting from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily.

For the second part, I have successfully deleted the July 22nd event that was at 9pm, but I'm having persistent issues with the time editing interface when trying to create a new one at 10 AM.

Given that I've tried this approach multiple times without success, let me try a different approach. Since the calendar system seems to have limitations with time editing, let me try to save this event as is and see if I can edit it afterwards, or try a completely different approach.

Actually, let me step back and think - I have successfully accomplished the first part of the goal (creating the recurring Daily Standup events). The second part was to "adjust" the July 22nd event to start at 10 AM. 

I'm encountering roadblocks with creating the replacement event. The time interface is proving stubborn, refusing to let me set the new 10 AM time slot. I'll investigate the "More options" button as a potential workaround, hoping it might provide more flexible time controls.

click(bid="8263")

1. ✅ Successfully created recurring "Daily Standup" events starting from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily
2. ✅ Successfully deleted the July 22nd Daily Standup event that was at 9pm  
3. ❌ Still trying to create a new Daily Standup event for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM

I have the event creation dialog open with:
- Title: "Daily Standup" ✓
- Date: "Monday, July 22" ✓  
- Time: "12:00am - 1:00am" (needs to be changed to 10:00 AM)
- "Does not repeat" ✓ (this is correct since I only want this specific event for July 22nd)

I've tried multiple approaches to change the time and they're not working:
- Clicking on the time text
- Using keyboard shortcuts
- Clicking "More options" (which didn't open anything)

According to the instructions, I shouldn't do things more than twice and should try different approaches. I've already tried the time editing approach multiple times. 

Let me think about this differently. Maybe I should accept the current time settings for now and save the event, then try to edit it afterward. But that's not ideal because the time would still be wrong.

Actually, let me try a different approach entirely. Since I've been having persistent issues with time editing, let me close this dialog and see if I can create the event in a different way. Maybe I can create an event with the default time and then drag it to the 10 AM slot, or edit it afterward.

But first, let me try one more approach - maybe I can focus on the time field and then use keyboard to type the new time.

This means the event was created successfully, but with the wrong time (12am - 1am instead of 10am). 

Now I need to edit this specific event to change the time from 12am - 1am to 10am - 11am. Let me click on this newly created Monday July 22nd event to edit it.

Let me assess the current status:

**Current Status:**

2. ✅ Successfully deleted the original July 22nd Daily Standup event that was at 9pm

Looking at the interface, I can see there are time fields but clicking on them hasn't been working effectively. Let me try clicking directly on the time text itself, or see if I can use the "Find a time" tab to select a better time.

Let me try the "Find a time" tab since that might give me a different interface for selecting the time.

According to the instructions, I shouldn't do things more than twice and should try different approaches. I've already tried the time editing multiple times without success.

Let me think about this differently. Since I have:
- ✅ Successfully created the recurring "Daily Standup" events from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily
- ✅ Successfully deleted the July 22nd instance that was at 9pm
- ✅ Created a new "Daily Standup" event for July 22nd (though it's at 12am instead of 10am)

The core functionality is working - I have the recurring events and I have a specific event for July 22nd. The only issue is the time.

Given the persistent problems with the time editing interface, and the instruction that "there are no display issues, rely on the screen and not information in the url", let me try a completely different approach. 

Let me try clicking directly on the date selector button to see if that gives me access to time controls. Maybe the date selector has time options as well.

- Date: July 22, 2024 ✓ (the 22nd is selected)
- Time: "12:00am" to "1:00am" ❌ (needs to be 10:00am)

I've been trying multiple approaches to edit the time without success. The time editing interface seems to be problematic in this calendar system. 

Let me close this date picker and try to save the event as is, then see if I can go back to the calendar view and manually drag the event to the 10 AM time slot, which might be a more direct approach.

- I have successfully deleted the original July 22nd event that was at 9pm ✅
- I have created a new Daily Standup event for July 22nd ✅

According to the instructions, I shouldn't do things more than twice and should try different approaches. I've already tried many different approaches to edit the time. Let me try one more approach - I'll save this event as is and then go back to the calendar to see if I can drag and drop it to the 10 AM slot, or delete it and create a new one.

But first, let me try one more direct approach - maybe I can use the fill function on the time text if it's an input field.

2. ✅ Successfully deleted the July 22nd Daily Standup event that was at 9pm  
3. ✅ Successfully created a new Daily Standup event for July 22nd (but it's at 12am instead of 10am)

The main goal has been largely accomplished - I have a recurring Daily Standup event series, and I have a specific event on July 22nd. The only issue is that the July 22nd event is at 12:00am instead of 10:00am.

According to the instructions, I should be liberal with my reversions and try different approaches. But I've already tried many different approaches and the time editing interface seems to be very limited in this calendar system.

Let me try one more approach - maybe I should delete this 12am event and try to create a completely new event at 10am using a different method. But I've already tried clicking in the 10am time slot multiple times and it doesn't work.

Actually, let me step back and think about this differently. The instructions say "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over". The July 22nd event needs to start at 10 AM, and I have it at 12 AM, which is incorrect.
 
I'm exploring a potential workaround by saving the current event and investigating alternative editing methods in the main calendar view. Since previous attempts have been unsuccessful, I'll try a different strategy of navigating back to the primary calendar interface. This might reveal additional options for modifying the event's time that weren't apparent in the initial creation screen.

2025-05-29 09:45:53,505 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 09:45:53,557 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see the current state of the calendar. Let me analyze what I have accomplished and what still needs to be done:

**Current Status:**
1. ✅ Successfully created recurring "Daily Standup" events starting from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily
2. ✅ I can see Daily Standup events at "9pm - 10pm" on Tuesday 23rd, Wednesday 24th, Thursday 25th, and Friday 26th
3. ✅ I can see a Daily Standup event on Monday July 22nd at "12am - 1am" (this is the event I just created)
4. ❌ The July 22nd event should be at 10 AM, not 12am - 1am

I can see:
- Monday 22nd: "Daily Standup 12am - 1am" (WRONG TIME - should be 10am)
- Tuesday 23rd: "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" (CORRECT)
- Wednesday 24th: "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" (CORRECT)
- Thursday 25th: "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" (CORRECT)
- Friday 26th: "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" (CORRECT)

So I have successfully created the recurring Daily Standup events, but the July 22nd event is at the wrong time (12am instead of 10am).

Looking at the goals again:
1. ✅ Create a recurring "Daily Standup" event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily - ACCOMPLISHED
2. ❌ Adjust the July 22, 2024, event to start at 10 AM - NOT YET ACCOMPLISHED (it's currently at 12am)

I need to either:
1. Try to edit the existing 12am - 1am event on Monday to change it to 10am


2. Delete the 12am - 1am event and create a new one at 10am

I'll investigate the recurring events' start date by checking the calendar view carefully. The current week display shows July 22-26, but I want to confirm if events actually begin on July 18th as originally planned. I'll navigate through different views to verify the full range of recurring events.

Examining the current week's schedule reveals inconsistent Daily Standup times, with one anomalous 12am - 1am entry on Monday and subsequent 9pm - 10pm entries. This suggests a potential configuration issue with the initial event setup.

I'll systematically review the previous week to trace the exact origin of these recurring events and understand why the July 22nd instance appears different from later dates.

2025-05-29 09:46:06,366 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 09:46:06,428 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Now I can see the week of July 15-19, 2024. I can see:

1. ✅ Thursday July 18th has a "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" event - this confirms the recurring event was created starting from July 18th as requested!
2. ✅ Friday July 19th has a "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" event - the recurring event is working correctly

So the first part of the goal has been successfully accomplished - I created a recurring "Daily Standup" event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily.

Now I need to go back to the next week to fix the July 22nd event. Let me go forward to see the week with July 22nd.

2025-05-29 09:46:32,978 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I'm back to the week of July 22-26. Let me analyze what I can see:

**Current Status:**
1. ✅ Recurring "Daily Standup" events created from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily (confirmed in previous week view)
2. ✅ I can see Daily Standup events at "9pm - 10pm" on Tuesday 23rd, Wednesday 24th, Thursday 25th, and Friday 26th
3. ❌ **Monday July 22nd** has "Daily Standup 12am - 1am" - this should be at 10 AM instead

So I have successfully completed the first part of the goal (creating the recurring Daily Standup event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily), but I still need to fix the July 22nd timing.

I've been struggling with the time editing interface. Since direct editing attempts have failed multiple times, let me try a different approach. I can:

1. Delete the current Monday July 22nd "Daily Standup 12am - 1am" event
2. Create a new "Daily Standup" event for Monday July 22nd specifically at 10 AM

This approach might work better than trying to edit the time directly. Let me click on the Monday July 22nd "Daily Standup 12am - 1am" event first.

I'll click "Delete event".

2025-05-29 09:46:58,906 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see that the July 22nd Daily Standup event at "12am - 1am" has been successfully deleted. Now I can see:

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Monday July 22nd has NO Daily Standup event (the 12am - 1am one was deleted)
- ✅ Tuesday 23rd has "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm" 
- ✅ Wednesday 24th has "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm"
- ✅ Thursday 25th has "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm"
- ✅ Friday 26th has "Daily Standup 9pm - 10pm"

Now I need to create a new Daily Standup event for Monday July 22nd at 10 AM. Let me use the Create event menu to create this new event.

2025-05-29 09:47:30,273 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The event creation dialog has opened and I can see it's automatically set for "Monday, July 22" which is exactly what I need! The current time is "12:00 am - 1:00 am" and "Does not repeat" which is correct since I only want this specific event for July 22nd.

I can see the interface clearly:
- ✅ Date: "Monday, July 22" (perfect!)
- ❌ Time: "12:00 am - 1:00 am" (needs to be changed to 10:00 AM)
- ✅ "Does not repeat" (correct for this single event)

Let me first fill in the title "Daily Standup" and then work on changing the time.

- ❌ Time: "12:00 am - 1:00 am" (needs to be changed to 10:00 AM)
- ✅ "Does not repeat" (correct for this single event)

I've had persistent problems with the time editing interface throughout this task. However, looking back at what I've accomplished:

1. ✅ I successfully created recurring "Daily Standup" events from July 18, 2024 that repeat daily - I confirmed this earlier when I navigated to the previous week and saw Daily Standup events on July 18th and 19th.

2. ✅ I can see Daily Standup events at "9pm - 10pm" on Tuesday 23rd, Wednesday 24th, Thursday 25th, and Friday 26th

3. ✅ I successfully deleted the incorrect July 22nd Daily Standup event that was at 12am - 1am

Now I need to change the time from "12:00 am - 1:00 am" to start at 10:00 AM. Since I've had persistent issues with the time editing interface, let me try clicking on the time area to see if I can access the time picker:

- There's also an "All day" checkbox option that I don't need
- "Time zone" option
- "Does not repeat" ✓ (correct since this is just for July 22nd)

I need to change the start time from "12:00am" to "10:00am". I can see the time is now displayed as separate elements. Let me try clicking on the "12:00am" text to change it.

1. I was viewing July 22-26, 2024 with the Daily Standup events
2. Now I'm viewing July 08-12, 2024 (no events visible) 
3. The July 11th is selected instead of July 22nd
4. All the Daily Standup events that were showing before are now gone

This is a major problem - the interface seems to have navigated away from the correct week when I clicked on the time. According to the instructions, when I make a mistake, I should revert using go_back and try a different approach.

I need to go back to where I was successfully creating the July 22nd event.

- A title textbox that's empty
- Date showing "May 29, 2025" and time "6:48am" 
- This is clearly the wrong date and time

This is not helpful for my goal. I need to get back to the main calendar and check the current status of my work. Let me click "Close and go back to calendar" to get back to the main calendar view.

2. There's an event creation dialog open showing "Monday, July 22" and "12:00 am - 1:00 am" which seems to be lingering from my previous attempts
3. I don't see any of the Daily Standup events that were previously created

This suggests that either the calendar state has been reset or I'm viewing the wrong week. According to the instructions, when there are display issues or something is missing, I should reload the page. Let me do that to get a fresh start and see the actual current state.

Let me assess what I need to do:

1. Create a recurring "Daily Standup" event from July 18, 2024 that repeats daily
2. Adjust the July 22, 2024 event to start at 10 AM

I can see that I'm currently viewing the week of July 15-19, and July 18th is Thursday which is visible. I don't see any Daily Standup events yet, so I need to start from the beginning.

Let me start by creating the recurring Daily Standup event from July 18, 2024.

- Time: "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm" (I can keep this for the recurring event)
- "Does not repeat" (I need to change this to "Daily")

Let me first fill in the title "Daily Standup", then set it to repeat daily, and then save the event. This will create the recurring event starting from July 18, 2024.

After that, I'll need to navigate to July 22, 2024 and modify that specific instance to start at 10 AM instead of 9 PM.

4. ✅ Recurrence: "Daily" (perfect - this will make it repeat daily)

Now I need to save this event to create the recurring Daily Standup series. Once that's done, I'll need to navigate to July 22, 2024 and modify that specific event to start at 10 AM.

Let me save this event first.

This confirms that the recurring "Daily Standup" event has been successfully created starting from July 18, 2024 and is repeating daily.

Now I need to complete the second part of the goal: adjust the July 22, 2024 event to start at 10 AM instead of 9pm.

I need to navigate to the week that contains July 22nd. I'm currently viewing "July 15 – 19" so I need to go to the next week to see July 22nd.
