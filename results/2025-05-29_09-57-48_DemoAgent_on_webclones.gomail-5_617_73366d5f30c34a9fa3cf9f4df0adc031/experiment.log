2025-05-29 09:58:03,636 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The user wants me to schedule an email to jane.doe@example.com with the subject "Weekly Update" to be sent next Monday at 9:00 AM. 

Looking at the current state, I can see we're on a GoMail workspace page that is loading (progress bar at 50%). The URL is https://evals-gomail.vercel.app/.

I should wait for the page to finish loading first, then explore the interface to find how to compose and schedule an email.

Let me start by waiting for the page to load completely and then taking a screenshot to see what's available.

2025-05-29 09:58:18,562 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to schedule an email to jane.doe@example.com with the subject "Weekly Update" to be sent next Monday at 9:00 AM. 

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm in the GoMail inbox. I can see the main navigation menu which includes options like "Compose", "Inbox", "Starred", "Snoozed", "Sent", "Scheduled", and "Drafts". The "Scheduled" menu item suggests this email client has scheduling functionality.

To compose and schedule an email, I should first look for a compose button or function. I can see "Compose" is mentioned in the navigation area at the top, but I don't see it as a clickable element in the state. Let me look more carefully...

Looking at the navigation section, I see:
- StaticText 'Compose' (this might be a header or label)
- Various menu items like Inbox, Starred, etc.

I don't see a clear "Compose" button yet. Let me explore to find how to start composing an email. I should look for a compose button, which is typically prominently displayed in email applications.

Actually, let me look more carefully at the page. There should be a compose button somewhere. Let me take a screenshot first to see the current visual state.

2025-05-29 09:58:33,401 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at the current state, I can see I'm in the GoMail inbox interface. I need to schedule an email to jane.doe@example.com with the subject "Weekly Update" to be sent next Monday at 9:00 AM.

Let me examine the interface:
1. I can see there's a navigation menu on the left with "Compose" at the top
2. There are various menu items like "Inbox", "Starred", "Snoozed", "Sent", "Scheduled", "Drafts", etc.
3. I can see a list of emails in the main area

To compose and schedule an email, I need to:
1. Click on "Compose" to start creating a new email
2. Fill in the recipient (jane.doe@example.com)
3. Fill in the subject ("Weekly Update")
4. Write the email content
5. Find the scheduling option to set it for next Monday at 9:00 AM

Let me start by looking for the Compose button. Looking at the state, I can see "StaticText 'Compose'" in the navigation area, but I need to find the actual clickable element. It might not have a browser ID visible in the current state representation.

Let me take a screenshot first to see the visual layout, and then look for the compose button.

action:
click(bid="129")

2025-05-29 09:58:53,833 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 09:58:53,876 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I clicked on the navigation element [129] which had "Compose" in it, but the page state shows no changes. This suggests that clicking on the navigation element didn't work as expected. Let me think about this:

1. I see "Compose" mentioned in the navigation area, but when I clicked on element [129] (which was the navigation element), nothing happened.
2. I need to find the actual compose button to start composing an email.
3. Looking at the page state, I can see the navigation menu items like "Inbox menu item", "Starred menu item", etc., but I don't see a specific "Compose" button.

Let me look more carefully at the page structure. I see:
- Navigation with menu items like Inbox, Starred, Snoozed, Sent, Scheduled, Drafts, More
- But I also see "StaticText 'Compose'" in the navigation area

The issue might be that "Compose" is just static text and not a clickable button. Let me look for an actual compose button. In Gmail-like interfaces, the compose button is usually prominently displayed, often as a button near the top of the sidebar.

Looking at the structure again, I see that there's "StaticText 'Compose'" but no clickable compose button element that I can identify in the current state. This might mean:
1. The compose button is not visible in the current state
2. I need to scroll or look elsewhere
3. There might be a compose button that's not showing up in the accessibility tree

Let me try taking a screenshot to see what's actually visible on the page, and then try to find the compose button.

Looking at the page state, I can see there's a navigation area with "Compose" mentioned as StaticText, but I'm not seeing a clickable compose button element. Let me examine the structure more carefully.

In the navigation section [129], I can see:
- StaticText 'Compose'
- Various menu items like Inbox, Starred, Snoozed, Sent, Scheduled, Drafts, More

The "Compose" appears to be just static text, not a clickable element. Let me look more carefully for a compose button. Sometimes these interfaces have a floating action button or a prominent compose button somewhere else on the page.

Let me take a screenshot first to see the visual layout and identify where the compose button might be located.

I can see there's a "Compose" button in the top left corner of the left sidebar that appears to be clickable (I can see it has a pencil icon and looks like a button).

This suggests that my click didn't actually open the compose dialog. Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state and look for the actual compose button. I need to be more careful about identifying the correct element.

2025-05-29 09:59:45,428 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I can see the "Compose" button clearly in the top left corner of the interface with a pencil icon. I clicked on it but it didn't open a compose dialog - instead it focused the search box. Let me try clicking directly on the "Compose" button. Looking at the screenshot, I can see it clearly at the top left.

Let me try to click on the exact compose button. From the state I can see there are different element IDs. Let me look for the actual compose button in the state data that corresponds to what I see in the screenshot.

Looking at the state, I don't see a clear compose button element. But I can see it visually in the screenshot. Let me try using mouse coordinates to click on the compose button since the element ID might not be working correctly.

From the screenshot, the compose button appears to be at approximately coordinates (70, 98) - it's the white rounded button with the pencil icon and "Compose" text.

action:
mouse_click(x=70, y=98)

2025-05-29 09:59:59,144 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The compose dialog has opened successfully. I can see the "New Message" dialog with:
- Email input combobox (bid 1053)
- Subject textbox (bid 1058)
- Send button (bid 1203)
- Various formatting buttons and options

I need to:
1. Fill in the recipient email: jane.doe@example.com
2. Fill in the subject: "Weekly Update"
3. Look for scheduling options to set it for next Monday at 9:00 AM
4. Send/schedule the email

Let me start by filling in the recipient email address.

action:
fill(bid="1053", value="jane.doe@example.com")

Now I need to:
1. Fill in the subject field with "Weekly Update"
2. Look for scheduling options to send it next Monday at 9:00 AM

Let me fill in the subject field next.

action:
fill(bid="1058", value="Weekly Update")

1. The recipient email: jane.doe@example.com (showing as a button now)
2. The subject: "Weekly Update" (showing in the heading and textbox)

Now I need to find the scheduling option to send this email next Monday at 9:00 AM. I can see there's a "Send" button (bid 1203) but I need to look for scheduling options. In Gmail, there's usually a dropdown arrow next to the Send button or an option to schedule send. 

I can see there's a button with a dropdown arrow (bid 1205) next to the Send button - this is likely where the scheduling options are. Let me click on that to see the scheduling options.

action:
click(bid="1205")

2025-05-29 10:00:39,297 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The schedule send dialog opened. I can see several options:

1. "Tomorrow morning" - May 30, 8:00 AM
2. "Tomorrow afternoon" - May 30, 1:00 PM  
3. "Monday morning" - Jun 2, 8:00 AM
4. "PICK DATE & TIME" for custom scheduling

I need to schedule for "next Monday at 9:00 AM". I can see there's a "Monday morning" option that shows "Jun 2, 8:00 AM", but I need it to be 9:00 AM, not 8:00 AM. So I should use the "PICK DATE & TIME" option to set the exact time I need.

Let me click on "PICK DATE & TIME" to set the custom date and time.

action:
click(bid="1264")

2025-05-29 10:00:50,204 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! Now I have the custom date and time picker. I can see it currently shows "05/29/2025 10:59 AM". I need to set it to next Monday at 9:00 AM. 

Looking at the previous dialog, it showed "Monday morning" as "Jun 2, 8:00 AM", which means June 2nd is the next Monday. So I need to set the date to 06/02/2025 and time to 09:00 AM.

I need to change the textbox value from "05/29/2025 10:59 AM" to "06/02/2025 09:00 AM".

action:
clear(bid="1279")

The Schedule send button is now disabled, which makes sense since there's no valid date entered. I need to enter the correct date and time for next Monday at 9:00 AM.

From the previous screen, I saw that Monday was June 2nd, so I need to enter: 06/02/2025 09:00 AM

Let me fill this in the textbox.

action:
fill(bid="1279", value="06/02/2025 09:00 AM")

2. The "Choose date" button now shows "Choose date, selected date is Jun 2, 2025" confirming the date is recognized
3. The "Schedule send for the selected custom date" button is now enabled (no longer disabled)

This looks correct - June 2nd, 2025 at 9:00 AM is next Monday at 9:00 AM as requested. Now I need to click the "Schedule send for the selected custom date" button to confirm the scheduling.

1. In the left navigation, I can see "Scheduled menu item, 1 unread" - this shows that there is now 1 scheduled email, which is exactly what I just created.

2. The page returned to the main inbox view, which indicates the email scheduling operation was completed successfully.

3. The email I scheduled was:

   - Subject: "Weekly Update"  
   - Scheduled for: Monday, June 2, 2025 at 9:00 AM

The task has been completed successfully. The scheduled count went from 0 to 1, confirming that my email was properly scheduled. I should now send a message to the user confirming that the task was completed.

action:
