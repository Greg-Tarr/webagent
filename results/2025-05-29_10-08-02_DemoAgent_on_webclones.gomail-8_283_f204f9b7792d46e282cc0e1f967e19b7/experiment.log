Currently, I can see the page is loading - there's a progress bar at 50% with an animated logo. I should wait for the page to fully load first before taking any action.

Let me wait for the page to fully load and then explore the interface to see what options are available for managing emails.

2025-05-29 10:08:31,567 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to clear all emails from "GitHub" in the inbox to trash. Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the inbox page with 17 unread emails. I can see there are 54 total emails (1-50 of 54 is shown).

Let me first scan through the visible emails to identify any GitHub emails. Looking through the list, I can see:

1. Email from Noreply with subject "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" (item 416)

That's the only email I can see with "GitHub" in the subject line on this page. However, since there are 54 total emails and only 50 are shown, I need to check if there are more GitHub emails on the next page.

The page shows "1-50 of 54" which means there are 4 more emails on the next page. I should navigate to see all emails first to identify all GitHub emails.

Let me scroll down or look for a way to see more emails.

action:
scroll(delta_x=0, delta_y=500)

From the current view, I can see one GitHub email:
- Email from "Noreply" with subject "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository"

Since there are 4 more emails (51-54), I need to check if there are any more GitHub emails. Let me look for a way to see the remaining emails. I need to scroll down or find pagination controls.

Looking at the current state:
- I'm on the GoMail inbox page with 54 total emails
- Only emails 1-50 are shown (as indicated by "1-50 of 54")
- I can see one GitHub email in the visible list: "Noreply" with subject "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository"

According to the instructions, I need to:
1. First explore to see ALL emails (including the remaining 4 emails) to count total GitHub emails
2. Then take action to move them to trash

Since there are 54 total emails but only 50 showing, I need to find a way to see the remaining 4 emails. I should look for pagination controls or a "next" button to see the remaining emails.

Let me scroll down more or look for navigation controls to see the remaining emails.

Looking at the current state, I can see there are 54 total emails but only 1-50 are displayed. I need to first explore all emails to find ALL GitHub-related emails before taking action.

From what I can see in the current view, there's one GitHub-related email:
- Email from "Noreply" with subject "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository"

But I need to see the remaining 4 emails (51-54) to make sure there aren't any more GitHub emails. I tried scrolling but that didn't reveal more emails. Let me look for pagination controls or try a different approach to see all emails.

Looking at the current interface, I see:
- There's a paragraph showing "1-50 of 54" which indicates there are more emails
- I need to find a way to navigate to see emails 51-54

Let me look for navigation buttons around the email list area. I should look for "Next" buttons or page navigation controls.

This button might be for pagination to see more emails. I can see that it says "1-50 of 54" so there are 4 more emails I need to see. Let me try clicking this button to see if it takes me to the next page of emails.

Actually, let me look more carefully at the interface. I need to find a way to navigate to see emails 51-54. The button I clicked showed "More" tooltip, so this might be the right approach. Let me continue clicking it to see if it shows more emails.

I clicked on button 198 twice but it didn't seem to show me the next page. Let me look more carefully at the interface to find pagination controls.

From what I can see currently, there is one GitHub-related email:
- Email from "Noreply" with subject "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository"

But I need to see emails 51-54 to make sure there aren't more GitHub emails.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should scroll down more to see if there are pagination controls at the bottom, or maybe I should try using keyboard navigation like Page Down.

action:
keyboard_press(key="PageDown")

I need to find a way to see the remaining 4 emails to check if there are any more GitHub emails. The button I clicked (bid 198) seems to be a "More" button but it's not working to show more emails.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can use the search functionality to specifically search for "GitHub" emails first, which would be more efficient than trying to paginate through all emails.

Looking at the interface, I can see there's a search textbox with bid 99. Let me try searching for "GitHub" to find all GitHub-related emails.

1. Email from "No Reply" - "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" (Aug 10)
2. Email from "Noreply" - "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" (Aug 10) 
3. Email from "Support" - "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" (Jul 26)
4. Email from "Noreply" - "New Comment on Your Pull Request" (Jul 16)

Now I need to select all of these emails and move them to trash. I can see checkboxes for each email that I can use to select them. Let me select all 4 GitHub-related emails first.

The checkboxes have IDs:
- [403] for the first email
- [419] for the second email  
- [835] for the third email
- [1052] for the fourth email

Let me select all of them first, then look for a delete/trash option.

1. "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" from No Reply (Aug 10) - checked
2. "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply (Aug 10) - checked
3. "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" from Support (Jul 26) - checked
4. "New Comment on Your Pull Request" from Noreply (Jul 16) - checked

Now I need to find the delete/trash button to move these emails to trash. I can see earlier there was a "Report spam" button (bid 1074) that appeared when I started selecting emails. Let me look for a delete or trash button. I should look for action buttons at the top of the email list.

action:
take_screenshot()

1. All 4 GitHub-related emails are selected (all checkboxes are checked)
2. At the top of the email list, there's a toolbar with action buttons
3. I can see several icons including what appears to be a delete/trash button (the trash can icon)

From the screenshot, I can see the toolbar at the top has several buttons:
- Archive button
- Report spam button  
- Delete button (trash can icon)
- Move to folder button
- Labels button
- More actions button

I need to click the delete/trash button to move these emails to trash. Looking at the screenshot, the delete button appears to be the trash can icon in the toolbar.

Let me look at the browser IDs from the current state to find the delete button. I can see there are several buttons in the toolbar area around [193], [1074], etc. I need to find the delete button.

Looking at the state, I can see:
- [193] button ''
- [1074] button 'Report spam' 
- [198] button ''

The delete button should be one of these. Let me try clicking what should be the delete button.

action:
click(bid="193")

2025-05-29 10:11:11,101 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 10:11:11,128 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I clicked on what I thought was the delete button (bid 193), but the emails are still showing in the list. The button is now focused but I don't see any indication that the emails were moved to trash. Let me look at the screenshot again to identify the correct delete button.

From the screenshot, I can see there's a toolbar at the top with several icons. I need to identify which one is the delete/trash button. Looking at the toolbar buttons, I can see several icons. Let me try to identify the correct delete button from the state information or try a different approach.

Actually, looking at the state, I see the delete button might be a different element. Let me look for a delete button more carefully. Maybe I need to look for a button with "Delete" text or a trash icon.

From the screenshot, I can see there are action buttons in the toolbar area. Let me try to click on the actual delete/trash button. The button with bid 193 might not be the delete button.

Let me look at the other buttons available. I can see there's button 1074 which is "Report spam", but I need to find the delete button.

Actually, looking at the visual screenshot, I can see there are several action buttons in the toolbar. Let me try clicking on what appears to be the delete/trash icon in the toolbar.

Looking at the state more carefully, I might need to try a different button. The delete button might be represented differently in the DOM. Let me try to find it by looking for other buttons or using keyboard shortcuts.

Actually, let me try using the keyboard shortcut for delete, which is typically the Delete key or sometimes pressing 'd' for delete in Gmail-like interfaces.

action:
keyboard_press(key="Delete")

- Archive button
- Delete button (trash can icon)
- Mark as read/unread
- Snooze
- Move to
- Labels
- More actions

Let me try clicking on what appears to be the delete/trash button. From the screenshot, I can see the trash can icon which should be the delete button. Let me look at the browser IDs to find the correct delete button.

Looking at the state, I see there are several buttons in that area:
- [193] button '' - this was focused when I clicked it
- [1074] button 'Report spam'

But from the screenshot, I can clearly see there's a delete/trash icon. Let me try looking for other button IDs that might correspond to the delete action. Maybe I need to look at the actual toolbar icons from the screenshot.

From the screenshot, I can see the toolbar has several icons. The trash can icon should be the delete button. Let me try a different approach - maybe I need to look for a different button ID.

Let me try using coordinates to click on the delete button since I can see it clearly in the screenshot.

action:
mouse_click(x=402, y=86)

All the checkboxes have become unchecked (changed from checked='true' to checked='false'), which suggests that clicking on the delete/trash button actually worked and the emails were deselected. However, I still see all 4 emails in the list, showing "1-4 of 4" emails.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. The emails are still showing in the search results for "GitHub". This might mean:

1. The delete action worked and the emails were moved to trash, but I'm still viewing the search results which might be cached
2. Or the delete action didn't work properly

I should clear the search and go back to the main inbox to see if the GitHub emails are actually gone from the inbox. The search results might be showing outdated information.

Let me clear the search first and then check the main inbox to verify if the GitHub emails have been successfully moved to trash.

Looking through the emails, I can see:
1. "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" from No Reply (Aug 10) - this is still here!
2. "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply (Aug 10) - this is still here!
3. "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" from Support (Jul 26) - this is still here!

I can see at least 3 of the 4 GitHub emails are still showing in the inbox, which means my delete action didn't work properly. I need to try a different approach.

The delete action didn't work, so I need to try again. Let me search for GitHub emails again and try a different method to delete them.

action:
click(bid="99")

The delete action I tried earlier didn't work properly. Let me search for GitHub emails again and try a different approach to delete them. I need to be more careful this time.

Looking at the current state, I can see:
1. "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" from No Reply (Aug 10) - this is a GitHub email
2. "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply (Aug 10) - this clearly has [GitHub] in the subject
3. "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" from Support (Jul 26) - this is also a GitHub email based on the context from earlier

I also need to check if there's a 4th GitHub email. Earlier I found 4 total when I searched. Let me search for "GitHub" again to find all GitHub-related emails and then try a different deletion approach.

2. "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply (Aug 10) 
3. "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" from Support (Jul 26)
4. "New Comment on Your Pull Request" from Noreply (Jul 16)

I notice they all show "Inbox" in their details, which confirms they are still in the inbox and weren't moved to trash previously.

Now I need to select all these emails and try a different approach to delete them. I'll try selecting them one by one and then use a different delete method. Let me start by selecting all the emails.

action:

1. [403] checkbox 'Select email from No Reply', focused, checked='true'
2. [419] checkbox 'Select email from Noreply', checked='true'
3. [835] checkbox 'Select email from Support', checked='true'  
4. [1873] checkbox 'Select email from Noreply', checked='true'

This is perfect! I can also see that a "Report spam" button appeared in the toolbar: [1897] button 'Report spam'

This suggests that selecting one email in the search results selected all of them. Now I need to find the delete/trash button to move all these selected emails to trash. Let me look for a delete button in the toolbar.

2025-05-29 10:12:58,344 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see from the screenshot that all 4 GitHub emails are selected (they all have checkboxes that appear to be checked), and I can see the toolbar at the top with various action buttons. I can see:

1. Archive button (first icon)
2. Report spam button 
3. Delete button (trash can icon) - this is what I need!
4. Mark as read button
5. Snooze button
6. Move to folder button
7. Labels button
8. More actions button (three dots)

The delete button (trash can icon) is clearly visible in the toolbar. I need to click on it to move all the selected GitHub emails to trash.

action:
mouse_click(x=402, y=85)

2025-05-29 10:13:13,402 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The delete action was successful! I can see several key indicators that the GitHub emails have been successfully moved to trash:

1. The search results now show "No messages matched your search. Try using search options such as sender, date, size and more." - this means there are no GitHub emails found in the search anymore.

2. The inbox unread count has changed from "17 unread" to just "Inbox" (no unread count shown), indicating that emails have been removed.

3. All the GitHub emails that were previously listed are now gone from the search results.

4. The toolbar has changed back to the normal state without the "Report spam" button, indicating no emails are selected anymore.

Now I should clear the search and return to the main inbox to verify that the GitHub emails are no longer there, and then confirm the task is complete.

2025-05-29 10:13:22,488 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I cleared the search and it took me to a Settings page instead of the inbox. I can see the URL changed to show "Settings - fede.lopez@gmail.com". I need to navigate back to the inbox to verify that the GitHub emails are gone from the main inbox view. Let me click on the Inbox menu item.

The title changed from "Settings" to "Inbox", confirming I'm back in the inbox.

Now I need to verify that the GitHub emails have been successfully removed. I should take a screenshot to see the current state of the inbox and confirm that no GitHub emails are present.

Let me first wait a moment for the page to fully load, then take a screenshot to see the inbox state.

action:

2025-05-29 10:13:43,431 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at the screenshot, I can see I'm back in the main inbox and the interface looks clean with just the GoMail branding and navigation elements visible. There appear to be no emails visible in the main content area, which suggests the inbox might be empty or the emails aren't loading properly.

However, I should verify this more thoroughly. Let me scroll down or wait for the page to load the emails to make sure I can see the current state of the inbox properly. The fact that I don't see any emails at all is a bit concerning - I need to make sure the inbox has loaded properly and that I can see what emails remain.

Let me wait a moment for the page to load and then scroll to see if there are any emails visible.

2025-05-29 10:14:04,876 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The page is refreshing and I can see a loading screen with a progress bar at 50%. I need to wait for it to fully load and then verify that the GitHub emails have been successfully removed from the inbox.

From my previous actions, I successfully:
1. Found all 4 GitHub-related emails by searching for "GitHub"
2. Selected all 4 emails at once 
3. Clicked the delete/trash button to move them to trash
4. Confirmed that the search showed "No messages matched your search" indicating the emails were removed

Now I need to wait for the page to load completely and then check the main inbox to verify the GitHub emails are gone.

action:
noop(wait_ms=4000)

2025-05-29 10:14:27,534 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 10:14:27,598 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I can see the inbox page has loaded and I notice something concerning. Looking at the email list, I can still see GitHub-related emails in the inbox:

1. "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" from No Reply (Aug 10)
2. "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply (Aug 10) 
3. "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" from Support (Jul 26) - this looks like it could be GitHub-related based on the subject

Wait, let me look more carefully at the emails I can see. I can see:

1. "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" from No Reply (Aug 10) - this is definitely GitHub-related
2. "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply (Aug 10) - this is definitely GitHub-related  
3. "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" from Support (Jul 26) - this could be GitHub-related

So it appears that my delete action did NOT work properly. The GitHub emails are still in the inbox! I need to try again.

But first, let me double-check by searching again to see if there are still GitHub emails. I also notice that there are still 54 total emails (1-50 of 54 shown) and it shows "Inbox (17)" which means 17 unread emails. Previously there were also 17 unread, so the count didn't change, which suggests the emails weren't deleted.

This is concerning - my delete action appears to have failed. I need to try a different approach.

Let me search for "GitHub" again to confirm which emails are still there.

2025-05-29 10:14:56,790 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The search worked and I can see exactly 4 GitHub-related emails (1-4 of 4):

1. "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" from No Reply (Aug 10) - checkbox ID 394
2. "[GitHub] Security Alert: Vulnerability Found in Your Repository" from Noreply (Aug 10) - checkbox ID 410  
3. "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" from Support (Jul 26) - checkbox ID 826
4. "New Comment on Your Pull Request" from Noreply (Jul 16) - checkbox ID 1039

All of these show "Inbox" which means they are still in the inbox and need to be moved to trash. Now I need to select all of them and delete them. Let me select them one by one and then delete them.

Let me start by selecting the first email.

action:
click(bid="394")

2025-05-29 10:15:06,403 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 10:15:06,435 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Good! I can see that selecting the first email has triggered some UI changes:

1. The first email's checkbox is now checked='true' and focused
2. The toolbar has changed - instead of just "Refresh" button, there's now a "Report spam" button, indicating that selection mode is active
3. However, I notice only ONE email is selected (the first one), not all 4 like before

I need to select the remaining 3 GitHub emails manually. Let me select the second one.

action:
click(bid="410")

2025-05-29 10:15:14,475 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

2025-05-29 10:15:33,703 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 10:15:33,727 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Now I have all 4 GitHub emails selected - all their checkboxes show checked='true'. I can see from the state that:

1. [394] checkbox 'Select email from No Reply', checked='true'
2. [410] checkbox 'Select email from Noreply', checked='true' 
3. [826] checkbox 'Select email from Support', checked='true'
4. [1039] checkbox 'Select email from Noreply', focused, checked='true'

All 4 GitHub emails are now selected. I also see there's a "Report spam" button in the toolbar: [1061] button 'Report spam'

Now I need to find the delete/trash button to move these emails to trash. Let me take a screenshot to see the full toolbar and locate the delete button.

5. A mark as read icon (envelope)
6. A snooze icon (clock)
7. A move icon (folder with arrow)
8. A labels icon
9. A more actions icon (three dots)

The delete/trash icon is clearly visible in the toolbar - it's the trash can icon, which should be the 4th icon from the left. This is the button I need to click to move all selected GitHub emails to trash.

Let me click on the delete/trash button to move these emails to trash.

3. All 4 GitHub emails that were previously listed are now gone
4. The action toolbar returned to normal state with "Refresh" button instead of "Report spam"

This confirms that all GitHub emails have been successfully moved to trash. Now I should clear the search and return to the main inbox to verify the task is completed, and then send a message to the user confirming success.

   - Updates  
   - No Reply (but not GitHub-related)
   - Notifications
   - Events
