2025-05-29 10:25:20,813 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to send a connection request to John Smith. Let me analyze the current state.

Looking at the current page, I can see this is a NetLink social networking platform similar to LinkedIn. I'm currently on the feed page (https://evals-networkin.vercel.app/platform/feed/).

I can see several posts from different users, including one from John Smith:
- Image at [298] shows 'John Smith'
- Link at [300] shows 'John Smith' with URL 'https://evals-networkin.vercel.app/platform/profile/?id=johnsmith'
- Heading at [301] shows 'John Smith'
- Job title: 'Designer at Creative Inc'

I can see John Smith's profile information, which suggests he has a post on the feed. To send a connection request, I typically need to go to his profile page. I can see there's a link to his profile at element [300].

Let me click on John Smith's name to go to his profile page, where I should be able to find a "Connect" button or similar option to send a connection request.

action:
click(bid="300")

2025-05-29 10:25:30,982 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see I'm now on John Smith's profile page. I can see his full name "John Smith" and his details:
- Senior Software Engineer  
- Los Angeles, California
- 800 connections
- Currently at NVIDIA
- Previously at Microsoft
- Graduated from MIT

Most importantly, I can see there's a "Connect" button (element 626) right at the top of his profile. This is exactly what I need to send a connection request to John Smith. Let me click on this Connect button.

Let me double-check the current state:
- I'm on John Smith's profile page (confirmed by the heading and URL)
- I can see the Connect button clearly
- This looks like the right action to take

I should click the Connect button to send the connection request.

action:
click(bid="626")

2025-05-29 10:25:42,500 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I clicked on the "Connect" button and now I see a modal dialog has appeared asking "Add a note to your invitation?". The dialog shows:

- Heading: "Add a note to your invitation?"
- Text explaining that I can personalize my invitation to John Smith by adding a note, and that NetLink members are more likely to accept invitations that include a note.
- Two buttons: "Add a note" and "Send without a note"

The goal is to send a connection request to John Smith. I can either:
1. Click "Add a note" to write a personalized message
2. Click "Send without a note" to just send the basic connection request

Since the goal doesn't specify that I need to add a note, and both options would successfully send a connection request, I think either would be acceptable. However, let me think about this more carefully.

The goal simply says "Send a connection request to John Smith." It doesn't specify whether to include a note or not. Both options would fulfill the goal, but adding a note is generally considered better practice for networking.

I'll go with "Send without a note" since the goal doesn't specify adding a note, and this is the most direct way to fulfill the requirement.

action:
click(bid="853")

2025-05-29 10:25:53,874 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on John Smith's profile page and the connection request has been successfully sent! 

Key evidence that the connection request was sent:
1. The "Connect" button that was previously visible (bid 626) has now changed to a "Pending" button (bid 856)
2. This clearly indicates that the connection request has been sent and is awaiting John Smith's response
3. All other elements on the page remain the same, confirming this is the correct profile page for John Smith

The task was to "Send a connection request to John Smith" and this has been completed successfully. The button changing from "Connect" to "Pending" is the standard behavior in LinkedIn-style platforms when a connection request has been sent.

I should now send a message to the user confirming that the task has been completed successfully.

action:
send_msg_to_user(text="Connection request sent successfully! I have sent a connection request to John Smith (Senior Software Engineer at NVIDIA in Los Angeles, California). The button on his profile page now shows \"Pending\" instead of \"Connect\", confirming that the request has been sent and is awaiting his response.")

2025-05-29 10:25:58,218 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.core.env - INFO - The active page and / or page history has changed during task.validate(). A recovery fix will be applied.
