2025-05-29 10:26:15,236 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at the current state, I'm on NetLink which appears to be a professional networking platform similar to LinkedIn. I can see a feed with several posts from different people. The goal is to:

1. Choose a random person who I haven't connected with
2. Connect with them 
3. Send them a message saying 'howdy, partner'

I can see several people in the feed:
- Alexa Richardson (Software Engineer at TechCorp)
- Jane Doe (Product Manager at Innovate Ltd)
- John Smith (Designer at Creative Inc)
- Michael Brown (Data Scientist at DataWorks)
- Ekaterina Tankova (CEO at Startup Hub)
- Sarah Brown (Marketing Specialist at AdVision)
- Daniel Rodriguez (HR Manager at PeopleOps)

I need to:
1. First explore to find more people if there are any (maybe scroll or check other sections)
2. Pick one randomly from those I haven't connected with
3. Visit their profile
4. Connect with them
5. Send them a message

Let me start by exploring the "My Network" section since that's where I'd typically find people to connect with.

action:
click(bid="66")

2025-05-29 10:26:28,018 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I'm now on the "My Network" page which shows people I can connect with. I can see several people listed under "Based on your recent activity" with "Connect" buttons next to them. These appear to be people I haven't connected with yet.

Let me examine the options:
1. John Smith - Senior Software Engineer
2. Emily Johnson - Data Scientist  
3. Jonathan Smith - Lead Software Engineer
4. Alexa Richardson - Senior Product Manager
5. Ekaterina Tankova - Data Scientist | AI Enthusiast | Innovator
6. Michael Brown - Senior Product Manager
7. Olivia Martinez - Marketing Specialist and Data Analyst
8. Daniel Rodriguez - Experienced Product Manager | Innovator in Tech

I need to choose one randomly. Let me pick Emily Johnson (the Data Scientist) - she seems like a good choice. I'll click the "Connect" button next to her name.

Let me click on Emily Johnson's "Connect" button (bid 327).

action:
click(bid="327")

2025-05-29 10:26:36,099 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I clicked the "Connect" button for Emily Johnson and now I see a dialog asking if I want to "Add a note to your invitation?". This is perfect because the goal asks me to connect with someone and send them a message saying "howdy, partner". 

I have two options:
1. "Add a note" - This would let me add a personalized message to the connection request
2. "Send without a note" - This would just send a basic connection request

Since the goal specifically asks me to send them a message saying "howdy, partner", I should click "Add a note" so I can include that specific message.

action:
click(bid="597")

2025-05-29 10:26:43,945 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I now have a dialog box that's asking me to add a note to my invitation to Emily Johnson. I can see there's a textbox where I can enter a message, and currently it shows "0/200" characters. The "Send" button is disabled, which makes sense since I haven't entered any text yet.

I need to fill in the textbox with the message "howdy, partner" as specified in the goal. Let me do that now.

action:
fill(bid="606", value="howdy, partner")

2025-05-29 10:26:54,790 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 10:26:54,826 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I have successfully:

1. Navigated to the "My Network" page
2. Found people I can connect with under "Based on your recent activity"
3. Chosen Emily Johnson (Data Scientist) as a random person to connect with
4. Clicked the "Connect" button next to her name
5. Chosen to "Add a note" to the invitation
6. Filled in the textbox with exactly "howdy, partner" as requested
7. I can see the character count shows "14/200" which matches the length of "howdy, partner"
8. The "Send" button is now enabled (no longer disabled)

Now I need to click the "Send" button to complete the connection request with the message. Let me check the current state:

- The textbox shows 'howdy, partner' as the value and is focused
- The character count shows "14/200" 
- The "Send" button is enabled (not disabled anymore)

This looks correct. The task asks me to:
1. Choose a random person who I haven't connected with ✓ (Emily Johnson)
2. Connect with them ✓ (initiated connection request)
3. Send them a message saying 'howdy, partner' ✓ (filled in the note field)

Now I just need to click Send to complete the action.

action:
click(bid="612")

2025-05-29 10:27:07,815 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Excellent! I can see that the connection request has been sent successfully. Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. Emily Johnson's button has changed from "Connect" to "Pending" (element [614])
2. All other people still show "Connect" buttons, indicating I haven't connected with them yet
3. The dialog box has closed and I'm back to the main My Network page

This confirms that I successfully:
1. Chose a random person (Emily Johnson) who I hadn't connected with
2. Connected with them by clicking the "Connect" button
3. Added a note with the message "howdy, partner" exactly as requested
4. Sent the connection request

The task has been completed successfully. The "Pending" status next to Emily Johnson's name confirms that the connection request with the message "howdy, partner" has been sent.

action:
send_msg_to_user(text="Task completed successfully! I chose Emily Johnson (Data Scientist) as a random person to connect with, clicked \"Connect\", added a note with the message \"howdy, partner\" exactly as requested, and sent the connection request. The button next to her name now shows \"Pending\" which confirms the invitation with the message has been sent.")
