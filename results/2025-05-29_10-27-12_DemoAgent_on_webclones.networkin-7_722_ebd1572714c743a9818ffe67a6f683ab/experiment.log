2025-05-29 10:27:30,076 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to search for three users who have worked at Amazon and list their current job positions. I'm currently on what appears to be a social networking platform (similar to LinkedIn) called NetLink.

Looking at the current state, I can see:
1. I'm on the feed page: https://evals-networkin.vercel.app/platform/feed/
2. There's a search box available (element [59])
3. I can see several user profiles in the feed, but none of them currently show Amazon as their company

The users I can see in the current feed are:
- Alexa Richardson - Software Engineer at TechCorp
- Jane Doe - Product Manager at Innovate Ltd
- John Smith - Designer at Creative Inc
- Michael Brown - Data Scientist at DataWorks
- Ekaterina Tankova - CEO at Startup Hub
- Sarah Brown - Marketing Specialist at AdVision
- Daniel Rodriguez - HR Manager at PeopleOps

None of these show Amazon as their workplace. I need to search for Amazon to find users who have worked there.

My approach should be:
1. Use the search box to search for "Amazon"
2. Look through the results to find users who have worked at Amazon
3. Identify their current job positions
4. Make sure I find exactly three users
5. List their current positions

Let me start by clicking on the search box and searching for "Amazon".

I'm on a search page for NetLink (https://evals-networkin.vercel.app/platform/search/?keywords=) and I can see search results. However, I notice the URL shows empty keywords, which suggests my search might not have been executed properly.

Looking at the page, I can see:
1. There are search filter tabs at the top: People, Posts, Companies, Jobs, Groups, Products, Services, Events, Courses, Schools
2. I can see people in the results, but I need to specifically look for people who have worked at Amazon
3. I can see one profile that mentions AWS and Amazon experience: "Mike (ChatGPT made this profile) Rubino" who has experience at "AWS--> Neuralink--> Chef Robotics--> Syelo"

However, I need to search more specifically for Amazon. Let me try to search again with the term "Amazon" in the search box.

Actually, let me first check the search box to see if it has the term Amazon in it or if I need to re-enter it.

Looking at the state, I see that textbox 'Search' (ID 59) doesn't show any value, so I need to search for Amazon again.

I can see that the search for "Amazon" has been executed and I'm now on the search results page with the URL showing `?keywords=Amazon`. I can see there are some people results showing up, but I need to look more carefully to find users who have worked at Amazon specifically.

Looking at the current page, I can see:

1. Jane Doe - Software Engineer - New York, New York
2. Jonathan Smith - Lead Software Engineer - New York, New York

But I need to check their profiles to see if they have worked at Amazon specifically. The search results might be showing people who mention Amazon or have some connection to Amazon, but I need to verify their work history.

Let me first check if there are more results by clicking "See all people results" to make sure I see all the available people before I start checking individual profiles.

I can see two people on this first page:

1. Jane Doe - Software Engineer (Current position) - New York, New York
2. Jonathan Smith - Lead Software Engineer (Current position) - New York, New York

However, I need to check their profiles to see if they actually worked at Amazon, since this search may just be finding people whose profiles mention "Amazon" in some way. But first, as instructed, I should explore through the pages to see how many total results there are and to find all people before analyzing specific profiles.

1. Page 2 is empty or hasn't loaded properly

3. There's a loading issue

I should continue exploring the pages to understand the total number of people. Let me go to page 3 to see if there are different people there.

2025-05-29 10:29:41,953 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm on page 3 now, but I'm still seeing the same content. This is strange - the pagination indicates there should be different content on different pages. Let me think about this:

1. I can see pagination shows pages 1-5 and page 10
2. But the content seems to be the same on all pages I've visited
3. I'm seeing Jane Doe (Software Engineer) and Jonathan Smith (Lead Software Engineer)

It's possible that:
- The pagination is not working correctly 
- There really are only 2 people total
- The content is not loading properly on different pages

Since I need to find 3 users who have worked at Amazon, I should:
1. First check if these 2 people actually worked at Amazon by clicking on their profiles
2. If they did work at Amazon, I need to find at least 1 more person

Let me first verify if Jane Doe and Jonathan Smith actually worked at Amazon by clicking on their profiles. I should start with Jane Doe.

Jane Doe:
- Current Position: Software Engineer at Microsoft (Jul 2018 - Present)
- Amazon Experience: Software Development Intern at Amazon (Jun 2017 - Aug 2017)

So Jane Doe did work at Amazon as an intern, and her current job position is Software Engineer at Microsoft.

That's 1 person who worked at Amazon. I need to find 2 more. Let me go back to the search results and check Jonathan Smith's profile, and then look for a third person.

Let me remember what I've found so far:
1. Jane Doe - Current position: Software Engineer at Microsoft (previously worked at Amazon as Software Development Intern)

2. Jonathan Smith - Lead Software Engineer 

Now I need to click on Jonathan Smith's profile to see if he worked at Amazon and what his current position is. Then I need to explore the other pages to find a third person who worked at Amazon.

Let me click on Jonathan Smith's profile.

action:

**Jonathan Smith - Found 2/3:**
- **Current Position:** Lead Software Engineer at Microsoft  
- **Amazon Experience:** Senior Software Engineer at Amazon (Jun 2015 - Dec 2019)

So far I have:
1. **Jane Doe** - Current: Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Software Development Intern at Amazon
2. **Jonathan Smith** - Current: Lead Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Senior Software Engineer at Amazon

Now I need to find a third person who has worked at Amazon. I need to go back to the search results and explore more pages since there might be more people. I saw pagination showing pages 1-5 and page 10, so there are likely more people to find.

Let me go back to the search results and check the other pages to find a third person.

2. I found Jonathan Smith - who has worked at Amazon as Senior Software Engineer and currently works as Lead Software Engineer at Microsoft

I need to find a third person. The pagination shows pages up to 10, so there might be more people. Let me try going to page 3 to see if there are more people there.

Actually, let me try a different approach. Maybe I should search differently or try to look at the suggested people in the recommendations sections. I noticed in Jonathan Smith's profile there were many suggested connections - maybe some of those people have worked at Amazon too.

Or I could try modifying my search strategy. Let me continue exploring the pagination first to see if there are more people.

This is concerning - it seems like the search results might only have these 2 people, even though there's pagination up to page 10. Let me continue exploring a few more pages to confirm if there are truly only 2 people in the Amazon search results.

I need to be thorough here since the task requires finding 3 people who have worked at Amazon, and I currently only have 2:

1. Jane Doe - Current: Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Software Development Intern at Amazon
2. Jonathan Smith - Current: Lead Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Senior Software Engineer at Amazon

However, I'm still seeing the same two people (Jane Doe and Jonathan Smith) on this page. It seems like there might only be 2 people in the search results for "Amazon", but the pagination is showing multiple pages for some reason.

I need to remember what I found so far:
1. Jane Doe - Current: Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Software Development Intern at Amazon
2. Jonathan Smith - Current: Lead Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Senior Software Engineer at Amazon

But I need to find three users who have worked at Amazon. Since there appear to be only 2 people in the current search results, I might need to try a different search approach. Maybe I should search for different terms related to Amazon or try a broader search.

Let me think about different approaches:
1. Try searching for "Amazon" in a different way
2. Search for "AWS" (Amazon Web Services)
3. Search for other Amazon-related terms
4. Try using filters to find more people

Since I only found 2 people in the current search and I need 3, I should try a different search term. AWS is a major part of Amazon, so people who worked on AWS would have worked at Amazon.

I already have:
1. Jane Doe - Current: Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Software Development Intern at Amazon

2025-05-29 10:32:14,029 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see Mike Rubino's profile, and I can see his work experience. Let me analyze it:

**Mike Rubino - Found 3/3:**
- Current Position: "Talent Advisor" at MultiOn (Jul 2024 - Present)
- Previous positions shown:
  - Senior Marketing Manager at Tesla (Jun 2018 - Dec 2021)
  - Marketing Manager at PepsiCo (Mar 2015 - May 2018)
  - Marketing Specialist at Boeing (Jan 2012 - Feb 2015)

However, I notice something important: His profile description mentions "AWS--> Neuralink--> Chef Robotics--> Syelo" and in the "About" section it says "His background includes notable stints at renowned organizations such as Neuralink and AWS where he significantly contributed to their success."

But looking at his actual work experience section, I don't see AWS or Amazon listed as a formal work experience. This is strange - the description mentions AWS but the experience section doesn't show it. This might mean AWS wasn't a formal employment or it's missing from the experience section.

Let me be careful here. The profile description and about section mention AWS, but the detailed experience section doesn't show it. Since I need to be exactly correct, and I already have 2 confirmed people (Jane Doe and Jonathan Smith) who definitely worked at Amazon with clear experience sections showing it, let me go back and see if I can find someone else with more concrete Amazon experience.

So far I have:
1. **Jane Doe** - Current: Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Software Development Intern at Amazon (confirmed via experience section)
2. **Jonathan Smith** - Current: Lead Software Engineer at Microsoft, Previous: Senior Software Engineer at Amazon (confirmed via experience section)

I need a third person with clearly documented Amazon experience. Let me go back and look for more people.
