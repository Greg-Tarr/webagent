2025-05-29 10:32:35,130 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The user wants me to search for two users who have worked at Microsoft and list their current job positions. Looking at the current page state, I'm on a social media platform called NetLink. I can see various user profiles in the feed, but none of them seem to mention Microsoft.

Let me think about how to approach this:

1. I need to search for users who have worked at Microsoft
2. I need to find their current job positions
3. I need to find at least two users

Looking at the current page, I can see there's a search textbox at the top (element [59]). I should start by searching for "Microsoft" to find users who have worked there.

Let me start by using the search functionality.

action:
click(bid="59")

2025-05-29 10:32:40,574 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Good, I've clicked on the search box and it's now focused. I can see there's a tooltip showing search suggestions, including "Software engineer", "UI Designer", "Software architect", and "React developer". I need to search for users who have worked at Microsoft. Let me type "Microsoft" in the search box.

action:
fill(bid="59", value="Microsoft")

2025-05-29 10:32:47,529 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I can see that I've searched for "Microsoft" and there are some results appearing in the search dropdown. I can see:

1. A "Microsoft" heading with some text about "Technology" 
2. A Microsoft company logo/image
3. A "See all results" option

I should click on "See all results" to see the search results for Microsoft and find users who have worked there.

action:
click(bid="696")

2025-05-29 10:33:00,152 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to search for users who have worked at Microsoft and find their current job positions. I can see I'm on a search results page, but looking at the search results, I don't see any Microsoft-related users clearly listed. The URL shows I'm on a search page but the keywords parameter is empty, which suggests the search may not have gone through properly.

Looking at the results, I see various users like:
- Mike Rubino (Co-Founder & Chief Product Officer) - mentions AWS and Neuralink
- Jane Doe (Software Engineer)
- John Smith (Senior Software Engineer) 
- Emily Johnson (Data Scientist)
- Jonathan Smith (Lead Software Engineer)
- Alexa Richardson (Senior Product Manager)
- Ekaterina Tankova (Data Scientist | AI Enthusiast | Innovator)
- Michael Brown (Senior Product Manager)
- Olivia Martinez (Marketing Specialist and Data Analyst)
- Daniel Rodriguez (Experienced Product Manager | Innovator in Tech)
- James Anderson (Operations and Project Management Expert)
- Laura Wilson (Senior Marketing Manager)

But none of these explicitly mention Microsoft in their current position. I need to actually search for Microsoft properly. Let me try searching again in the search box.

action:
click(bid="59")

Let me check the URL - I'm still on the search page but it seems like the search might not have been executed properly. Let me try a different approach - maybe I need to press Enter after typing Microsoft in the search box.

Let me try searching for Microsoft again and press Enter this time.

action:
click(bid="59")

1. Jane Doe - Software Engineer - New York, New York
2. John Smith - Senior Software Engineer - Los Angeles, California  
3. Jonathan Smith - Lead Software Engineer - New York, New York

However, these results don't show their connection to Microsoft yet. I need to click on individual profiles to see their work history and determine if they've worked at Microsoft. Let me first explore more of the search results by clicking "See all people results" to see if there are more users, and then I'll need to check individual profiles to see their work history.

But wait, I should first check if there are more search results by scrolling or looking for pagination. Let me scroll down to see if there are more results first.

action:
scroll(delta_x=0, delta_y=500)

I need to check each of these profiles to see who has actually worked at Microsoft and what their current positions are. I'll start by clicking on Jane Doe's profile to see her work history.

action:
click(bid="778")

1. **Jane Doe** - Currently works as **Software Engineer at Microsoft** (Jul 2018 - Present â€¢ 3 yrs 5 mos). So her current position is Software Engineer at Microsoft.

I need to find one more user who has worked at Microsoft. Let me go back to the search results and check other profiles. I can see in the "People you may know" section there are other profiles like John Smith, Emily Johnson, Jonathan Smith, etc. Let me go back to the search results to check these users.

I should remember:
- Jane Doe: Current position is Software Engineer at Microsoft (currently employed there)

Now I need to find someone else who has worked at Microsoft (either currently or previously).

action:
go_back()

2025-05-29 10:34:13,732 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Good, I'm back on the search results page. I can see the Microsoft search results. I already found Jane Doe who works as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. Now I need to find a second user who has worked at Microsoft.

Looking at the search results, I can see several users listed:
1. Jane Doe - Software Engineer (already checked, works at Microsoft)
2. John Smith - Senior Software Engineer 
3. Jonathan Smith - Lead Software Engineer
4. Alexa Richardson - Senior Product Manager
5. Emily Johnson - Data Scientist
6. Ekaterina Tankova - Data Scientist | AI Enthusiast | Innovator
7. Michael Brown - Senior Product Manager
8. Olivia Martinez - Marketing Specialist and Data Analyst
9. Daniel Rodriguez - Experienced Product Manager | Innovator in Tech
10. James Anderson - Operations and Project Management Expert
11. Laura Wilson - Senior Marketing Manager

I need to check the profiles of these users to see who has worked at Microsoft. Let me start with John Smith since he's a Senior Software Engineer and might have worked at Microsoft.

action:
click(bid="1711")

2025-05-29 10:34:25,144 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 10:34:25,189 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I found the second user. Looking at John Smith's profile, I can see that:

1. His current position is "Senior Software Engineer" at NVIDIA (Jan 2015 - Present)
2. He previously worked as a "Software Engineer" at Microsoft (Jul 2010 - Dec 2014)

So John Smith has worked at Microsoft in the past, but his current job position is Senior Software Engineer at NVIDIA.

Now I have the information for both users:

1. Jane Doe: Currently works as Software Engineer at Microsoft (Jul 2018 - Present)
2. John Smith: Currently works as Senior Software Engineer at NVIDIA (but previously worked at Microsoft from Jul 2010 - Dec 2014)

I should provide this information to the user.

action:
