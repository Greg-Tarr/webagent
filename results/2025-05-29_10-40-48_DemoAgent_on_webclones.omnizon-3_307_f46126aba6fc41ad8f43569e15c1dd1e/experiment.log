1. Scroll through the homepage
2. Click on the "Headphones" category card
3. Retrieve all product listings within that category

I'm currently on the Omnizon homepage. Looking at the state, I can see several category sections. Let me first take a screenshot to see the current visual state, then scroll through the homepage to see all available categories.

I can see in the DOM there are several sections with different categories. One section mentions "Wireless Tech" which includes:
- Smartphones
- Watches  
- Headphones
- Tablets

I can see there's an image with 'headphones' at element [454] and text 'Headphones' at [455]. This seems to be what I'm looking for.

But the user said to scroll through the homepage first, so let me do that to get a complete view of all the content before clicking on the headphones category.

Let me start by taking a screenshot to see the current state, then scroll down to see more content.

Looking at the current page state, I can see a "Results" region that contains multiple headphone products. Let me analyze what I can see:

Current headphone products on this page:
1. Sony WH-1000XM5 - $389.00 - Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones
2. JBL Tune 510BT - $39.95 - Wireless On-Ear Headphones 
3. Beats Studio Pro - $349.99 - Wireless Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones
4. Apple AirPods Pro 2 - $249.00 - Wireless Earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation
5. HyperX Cloud III - $99.99 - Wired Gaming Headset

However, I need to check if there are more products on additional pages. The task mentions that I should check for pagination or "next" buttons to count the total number of unique items. I need to explore if there are more pages or if this is all the products.

Looking at the page state, I don't see any obvious pagination elements or "next page" buttons in the current state. Let me scroll down to see if there are more products or pagination controls.

5. HyperX Cloud III - $99.99

I scrolled down but didn't see any pagination controls or "next page" buttons. The page seems to show just these 5 products. But I should be more thorough and check if there are any more products or pagination controls that I might have missed. Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state better.

I can see at the bottom of the page there's a "Back to top" link and then the footer content, which suggests this is the end of the product listings. I don't see any pagination controls like "Next page" or page numbers, which indicates that these 5 products represent the complete catalog for the headphones category.

Following the instructions, I should check for pagination carefully before concluding. Let me scroll back up to see if there are any pagination controls at the top of the results section that I might have missed.
