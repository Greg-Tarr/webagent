I can see multiple stays with their names, ratings, and prices. My goal is to "Compare all the stays listed by review quality and price and rank them by affordability."

Let me first check if there are more stays by scrolling down or checking for pagination. I can see many stays already on the page. Let me scroll down to see if there are more, as the instruction says I should first explore to count all items.

From what I can see so far, there are stays with various names, ratings (around 4.0-4.8), and prices (ranging from around $14 to over $900 per night). 

Let me scroll down to see if there are more stays and get a complete count.

Notably, the list includes unique stays in locations like Dublin, Athens, Pennsylvania, and Lake Saimaa, demonstrating a global approach to accommodation selection with varied architectural styles and settings.

The next set of listings expands this international range, featuring properties in Nice, Bordeaux, Glasgow, and Utila. Prices continue to vary widely, from budget-friendly $89 retreats to luxurious $986 lodges.
