I'm currently on a dashboard page at 'https://evals-topwork.vercel.app/platform/dashboard/' which appears to be a platform called "Topwork". It seems like this is a freelancing or job posting platform based on the name and URL structure.

Looking at the current state, I can see:
- I'm on a dashboard page
- There's a logo showing
- There's a progress bar that might be loading

Since I need to create a job post, I should first explore the interface to find where I can create new job posts. Let me take a screenshot to see the full page layout and identify navigation options.

action:

Let me analyze what I need to do:
1. Write a strong job title for a Frontend Developer with React and TypeScript expertise
2. Then proceed through the subsequent steps to specify project details, duration, skills, and budget

I can see there's a textbox (bid 503) where I need to enter the job title. Let me think of a good title for a Frontend Developer with React and TypeScript expertise.

Looking at the example titles:
- "Build responsive WordPress site with booking/payment functionality"
- "Graphic designer needed to design ad creative for multiple campaigns" 
- "Facebook ad specialist needed for product launch"

I should create a title that clearly states what I need: a Frontend Developer with React and TypeScript skills. A good title might be:
"Frontend Developer needed for React & TypeScript web application"

Let me fill in this title.

action:
fill(bid="503", value="Frontend Developer needed for React & TypeScript web application")

2025-05-29 13:05:11,943 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

2025-05-29 13:05:23,336 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 13:05:23,367 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I'm now on step 2/5 of the job posting process where I need to specify the required skills. I can see:

1. A textbox where I can type skills manually and add them
2. Popular skills for Software Development displayed as clickable headings
3. I can see "React" and "TypeScript" are both listed in the popular skills section

Since the goal specifically mentions Frontend Developer with expertise in React and TypeScript, I should select these skills. I can see both React and TypeScript are listed as popular skills, so I'll click on them. I should also add other relevant frontend skills like JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Let me click on the relevant skills:
1. React (bid 586)
2. TypeScript (bid 547) 
3. JavaScript (bid 544)
4. HTML (bid 580)
5. CSS (bid 583)

I'll start with React since that's a key requirement.

I can see it now appears under "Selected skills" and was removed from the popular skills list. Now I need to add TypeScript as well, which is one of the main requirements for this Frontend Developer position.

I can see TypeScript is still listed under "Popular skills for Software Development" at bid 547. Let me click on it to add it to the selected skills.

action:
click(bid="547")

- React
- TypeScript

This matches the requirements perfectly. The system recommends adding 3-5 skills for best results, so I should probably add a couple more relevant skills for a frontend developer position. Let me add JavaScript since it's fundamental for frontend development, and HTML/CSS since they're core frontend technologies.

Let me add JavaScript first:

action:
click(bid="544")

2025-05-29 13:05:47,187 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

I have React, TypeScript, and JavaScript selected, which are the core requirements. Since the system recommends 3-5 skills for best results, I could add HTML and CSS as well since they are essential for frontend development. Let me add HTML first.

action:

2025-05-29 13:05:54,528 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 13:05:54,555 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I've added HTML. Now let me add CSS as well to complete the core frontend skillset. I have:
1. React (main requirement)
2. TypeScript (main requirement) 
3. JavaScript (fundamental)
4. HTML (fundamental)

I should add CSS to make it 5 skills total, which fits the recommended 3-5 skills range.

action:
click(bid="583")

2025-05-29 13:06:03,945 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

- React (main requirement)
- TypeScript (main requirement) 
- JavaScript (fundamental for frontend)
- HTML (fundamental for frontend)
- CSS (fundamental for frontend)

This is exactly 5 skills, which fits perfectly within the recommended 3-5 skills range. I have both main requirements (React and TypeScript) plus the core fundamentals of frontend development. This should be a complete and professional skill set for the job post.

Now I should proceed to the next step which is "Scope" to specify project details like duration and budget.

1. Project size (Large, Medium, Small)
2. Duration (More than 6 months, 3-6 months, 1-3 months)
3. Experience level (Entry, Intermediate, Expert)
4. Contract-to-hire opportunity (Yes/No)

Since this is for a Frontend Developer with React and TypeScript expertise, I should make appropriate selections:

For project size: For a frontend development job with React and TypeScript, this would likely be a "Medium" project - well-defined projects like building a web application or significant frontend components.

For duration: A typical frontend development project might be "1 to 3 months" for a substantial but not massive project.

For experience level: Since this requires React and TypeScript expertise, I should select "Intermediate" - looking for substantial experience in this field.

For contract-to-hire: This depends on the client's needs, but I'll select "No, not at this time" to keep it as a straightforward contract project.

Let me start by selecting the project size - Medium.
