Looking at the current state:
- I'm on step 1/5 of the job post creation process
- The page is asking for a strong title for the job post
- There's a textbox (bid 499) where I can enter the title
- There are example titles provided for reference
- There's a progress bar showing 20% completion
- There are "Back" and "Next: Skills" buttons

I need to create a job posting for a Backend Developer specializing in Python, Django, and Flask to develop a high-performance web application. I should write a compelling title that includes the key technologies and the main goal.

Let me fill in a strong title for this backend developer position.

action:

This covers all the main requirements from the goal: Backend Developer specializing in Python, Django, and Flask, plus the additional required skills (PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, CI/CD).

The page indicates that I have 7 skills selected, which is more than the recommended 3-5 skills, but that should be fine since these are all essential skills for the project.

Now I need to proceed to the next step to continue building the job posting. I can see the "Next: Scope" button at the bottom. Let me click that to move to step 3 of 5.

action:
click(bid="513")

2025-05-29 13:10:29,724 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I'm now on step 3 of 5 - the scope estimation page. I need to fill out several sections:

1. Project size - I need to think about the scope of developing a "high-performance web application." This sounds like it would be a larger, more complex project than just a simple task or landing page. I should select "Large" for this.

2. Timeline - I need to estimate how long this will take. For a high-performance web application with all the technologies involved (Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, CI/CD), this sounds like it would be a substantial project. I should probably select "3 to 6 months" or potentially "More than 6 months" depending on complexity.

3. Experience level - Since this is for a "high-performance web application" and involves multiple complex technologies (Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, CI/CD), I should select "Expert" or "Intermediate" at minimum. Given the complexity, "Expert" seems most appropriate.

4. Contract-to-hire - This isn't specified in the goal, so I'll select "No, not at this time" as the conservative choice.

Let me start with the project size.

action:
click(bid="651")

2025-05-29 13:10:38,633 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 13:10:38,647 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I've selected "Large" for the project size, which is appropriate for developing a high-performance web application. Now I need to select the timeline. The goal mentions "estimated project timeline" but doesn't specify exactly how long. For a complex web application development project involving multiple technologies like Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, and CI/CD, this would typically take several months. I think "3 to 6 months" would be a reasonable timeline for such a project.

Let me select that option.

action:
click(bid="695")

2025-05-29 13:10:46,262 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 13:10:46,294 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I've selected "3 to 6 months" for the timeline, which is appropriate for a complex backend development project. Now I need to select the experience level. Given that this is for developing a high-performance web application with multiple complex technologies (Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, CI/CD), I should select "Expert" level to ensure the developer has comprehensive and deep expertise.

action:
click(bid="739")

2025-05-29 13:10:55,232 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 13:10:55,263 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I've selected "Expert" for the experience level, which is appropriate for a high-performance web application project requiring deep expertise in multiple technologies.

Now I need to select the contract-to-hire option. The goal doesn't specifically mention whether this should be a contract-to-hire opportunity or not. For a high-performance web application development project, it's common to start with a contract and potentially convert to full-time if the project goes well. However, I should be careful about making assumptions. Let me select "No, not at this time" to keep it as a straightforward contract project, which is more standard for project-based work.

action:
click(bid="767")

2025-05-29 13:11:06,858 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 13:11:06,881 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I've completed all the required selections for step 3:

1. Project size: Large (for complex high-performance web application)
2. Timeline: 3 to 6 months (appropriate for backend development project)
3. Experience level: Expert (for comprehensive expertise in multiple technologies)
4. Contract-to-hire: No, not at this time (straightforward contract)

All selections are made and I can see they are properly checked. Now I need to proceed to the next step which should be the budget section (step 4 of 5). Let me click "Next: Budget" to continue.

action:
click(bid="513")

2025-05-29 13:11:19,126 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I'm now on step 4 of 5 - the budget setting page. I can see that:

1. "Hourly rate" is already selected (radio button checked='true')
2. There are two spinbutton fields for "From" and "To" hourly rates
3. There's also a "Fixed price" option available

For a backend developer with expert-level skills in Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, and CI/CD, I need to set an appropriate hourly rate range. 

Given that this is for:
- Expert level experience
- Complex high-performance web application
- Multiple advanced technologies (Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, CI/CD)
- 3-6 month project timeline

For expert backend developers with these skills, typical hourly rates might range from $75-150/hour depending on location and specific expertise. I should set a competitive range that reflects the expert level and complex nature of the work.

Let me fill in the "From" field first with a reasonable starting rate, maybe $80/hour, and then set the "To" field to around $120/hour.

action:
fill(bid="816", value="80")

For expert-level backend development with all these complex technologies, I should set a reasonable upper range. I'll set it to $120/hour to give a good range for expert developers.

action:
fill(bid="826", value="120")

2025-05-29 13:11:35,593 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

I've successfully set the budget range to $80-$120/hour, which is appropriate for expert-level backend development work involving Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, and CI/CD for a high-performance web application.

Now I have completed:
1. Step 1: Title - "Backend Developer Needed - Python/Django/Flask for High-Performance Web Application"
2. Step 2: Skills - Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, CI/CD
3. Step 3: Scope - Large project, 3-6 months, Expert level, No contract-to-hire
4. Step 4: Budget - Hourly rate from $80 to $120/hr

I need to proceed to step 5 (Description) to complete the job posting. This is the final step where I'll add project details and description.

I can see there's a textbox where I can enter the description. The button at the bottom now says "Submit Job Post" instead of "Next", indicating this is the final step.

I need to write a comprehensive description that includes:
- Clear expectations about the task (developing a high-performance web application)
- The skills required (Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, CI/CD)
- Details about the project
- Timeline expectations
- Good communication expectations
