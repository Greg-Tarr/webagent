2025-05-29 13:58:17,636 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to book a ride from "333 Fremont Apartments" to "Le Colonial". Looking at the current state, I'm on the Udriver homepage which appears to be a ride-sharing service similar to Uber. 

The page shows:
- A navigation header with options like Ride, Drive, Business, Udriver Eats, About
- A main section with "Go anywhere with Udriver" and "Request a ride, hop in, and go."
- Two input fields: "Enter Location" and "Enter Destination"
- A "See prices for your ride" button

I need to:
1. Fill in the pickup location (333 Fremont Apartments)
2. Fill in the destination (Le Colonial)
3. Proceed to book the ride

Let me start by filling in the pickup location. I can see there are two comboboxes - one for location (bid 108) and one for destination (bid 118).

Let me first close the alert modal that's showing at the top by clicking the close button.

action:
click(bid="49")

1. A "Enter Location" combobox (bid 108) for the pickup location
2. A "Enter Destination" combobox (bid 118) for the destination
3. A "See prices for your ride" button (bid 121) to proceed

The alert has been closed successfully. Now I need to:
1. Fill in the pickup location: "333 Fremont Apartments" 
2. Fill in the destination: "Le Colonial"
3. Click to see prices/proceed with booking

Let me start by clicking on the pickup location field and entering the pickup address.

action:

I need to find "333 Fremont Apartments". I don't see it in the current list, so I should type it in to search for it. Let me type "333 Fremont Apartments" in the input field.

I can see that I typed "333 Fremont Apartments" into the pickup location field and it shows up in the dropdown as "333 Fremont Apartments - 333 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA". This is exactly what I need. Now I should click on this option to select it.

Let me check the current state:
- The pickup location field is focused and shows "333 Fremont Apartments"
- There's a dropdown with the exact match: "333 Fremont Apartments - 333 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA" 
- I need to click on this option to select it
- Then I need to fill in the destination field with "Le Colonial"

This looks correct so far. Let me click on the dropdown option to select it.

Now I need to fill in the destination field with "Le Colonial". Let me click on the destination combobox to open it and then search for Le Colonial.

Let me double check the current state:
- Pickup location: ✓ "333 Fremont Apartments - 333 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA" is selected
- Destination: ❌ Still needs to be filled with "Le Colonial"

Everything looks good so far. Now I need to click on the destination field.

The current state shows:
- Pickup location is correctly set to "333 Fremont Apartments - 333 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA"

This suggests that "Le Colonial" is not being found in the system. Let me think about this - maybe I need to be more specific or try a different approach.

Le Colonial is a restaurant, so maybe I need to include more specific information like "Le Colonial Restaurant" or maybe include the full address. Let me try clicking on the destination field again to see if there are other options available, or try a different search term.

First, let me click on the destination field to see if it opens a dropdown with available options again.

1. "Le Colonial" might not be in the system database
2. I might need to try a different variation or be more specific
3. Le Colonial is a restaurant, so maybe I need to add more details like the address or specify it's a restaurant

Let me try clearing the field and attempting a different search. Le Colonial is a well-known Vietnamese restaurant, so maybe I should try "Le Colonial restaurant" or include the full address. Actually, let me first clear the field and try to see what options are available by just clicking to see the dropdown again.

- 1 Hotel San Francisco
- 100 Van Ness 
- 1000 Chestnut Street Apartments
- 1001 Castro Street

Since "Le Colonial" didn't return any results when I typed it directly, I should try typing "Le Colonial restaurant" or "Le Colonial San Francisco" to be more specific. Le Colonial is likely a restaurant, so I should try including that context.

Let me try typing "Le Colonial restaurant" to see if that helps with the search.

1. The pickup location worked fine - "333 Fremont Apartments" was found
2. But "Le Colonial" and "Le Colonial restaurant" are both showing "No results"
3. This could mean that Le Colonial is not a recognized location in this ride-sharing app's database

I should try a few more approaches:
1. Try clearing and looking at all available destinations to see if there's something similar
2. Try different variations like "Le Colonial San Francisco" 
3. Try just typing "Colonial" to see if there are any colonial-related locations

Let me try clearing the field again and looking at what destinations are available, or try a variation with the full address.

1. I successfully selected the pickup location: "333 Fremont Apartments - 333 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA"
2. I'm having trouble with "Le Colonial" as a destination - it's not being found in the system
3. I can see the dropdown shows locations like "1 Hotel San Francisco", "100 Van Ness", etc. - these seem to be predefined locations in the system

Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should try "Le Colonial San Francisco" to be more specific, or try scrolling through the available destinations to see if Le Colonial is listed under a different name or format. I could also try typing just "Colonial" to see if it shows up.

Let me try "Le Colonial San Francisco" first.

1. Le Colonial might not be a recognized location in this app's database
2. I might need to try a different approach
3. Maybe I should explore the dropdown options more thoroughly to see what kind of destinations are available
4. Maybe I should proceed with the ride booking even with "Le Colonial San Francisco" since it might still work

Looking at the pattern of locations I've seen so far (hotels, apartments, addresses with street numbers), maybe Le Colonial isn't indexed in their system. However, I should try to proceed with the booking to see if it works, or maybe try a more specific address format.

Let me try one more approach with a more specific format, or see if I can proceed with the current entry.

2025-05-29 14:00:17,266 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I've tried multiple variations of "Le Colonial" and they're all showing "No results". This suggests that this specific restaurant or location isn't available in the Udriver system's database. I should look at what options are actually available in the dropdown. I can see there are a few sample locations showing:

1. 1 Hotel San Francisco - 8 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA
2. 100 Van Ness - 100 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA

4. 1001 Castro Street - 1001 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114, USA

Let me try typing "20 Cosmo Place" which is Le Colonial's actual address, but if that doesn't work, I may need to scroll through the available options or try a different approach. Perhaps the system has a limited set of destinations available.

Let me try "20 Cosmo Place" first.

1. "Le Colonial" - No results
2. "Le Colonial restaurant" - No results  
3. "Le Colonial San Francisco" - No results
4. "20 Cosmo Place" - No results

It seems like this destination might not be in their system. Let me think about this differently. I notice that all the locations shown in the dropdown have very specific formats like "1 Hotel San Francisco - 8 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA". Maybe I need to explore what destinations are actually available in the system.

Since I've tried multiple variations and none are working, perhaps I should:
1. Clear the field and look at all available options
2. Or try proceeding with what I have and see if the system will accept it
3. Or maybe there's a different approach entirely

Let me clear the field first and see what options are actually available by scrolling through the dropdown or looking for other ways to find Le Colonial.

- "Le Colonial" 
- "Le Colonial restaurant"
- "Le Colonial San Francisco"

All of these are returning "No results". The system seems to have a limited set of predefined locations that I can see in the dropdown:

- 1000 Chestnut Street Apartments - 1000 Chestnut St, San Francisco, CA 94109, USA
- 1001 Castro Street - 1001 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114, USA

I need to think about this differently. Let me try typing just "Le" to see if there are any variations or if Le Colonial might be listed under a different name. Or perhaps I should try searching for common letters like "L" to see what options appear.

Let me also keep in mind that sometimes destination systems don't have all locations, especially smaller or newer establishments. I should explore what's available and see if there's a nearby location that might work.

I'll try typing just "Le" first to see if any variations show up.

action:
fill(bid="118", value="Le")

2025-05-29 14:00:54,086 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! Now I can see a much longer list of locations when I typed "Le". I can see many different places in San Francisco. I'm looking for "Le Colonial" but I don't see it in this list. I can see "Lers Ros" and "Lers Ros Thai" which start with "Le" but no "Le Colonial".

Let me scroll through this list to see if there's anything that matches Le Colonial. I can see:
- Lers Ros - 730 Larkin St, San Francisco, CA 94109, USA
- Lers Ros Thai - 307 Hayes St, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA
- Legion of Honor - 100 34th Ave, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA
- Levi's Store - 815 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA

But none of these is "Le Colonial". It appears that "Le Colonial" is not in the system's database of locations. This is a problem - I can't book a ride to a destination that doesn't exist in the system.

Let me think about this. The instructions say "feel free to explore" and "don't do things more than twice, try different approaches". I've tried multiple variations:
1. "Le Colonial" - no results
2. "Le Colonial restaurant" - no results  
3. "Le Colonial San Francisco" - no results
4. "20 Cosmo Place" (the actual address) - no results
5. "Le" - shows many results but no Le Colonial

Since Le Colonial doesn't appear to be in the system, maybe I should try to find a nearby location or a similar restaurant. However, the user specifically asked for "Le Colonial" so I need to be honest about what's available.

Actually, wait. Let me try scrolling through this list more carefully to see if there are more entries. This might not be the complete list yet.

- Live Fit Gym • Hayes Valley - 301 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA
- Legion of Honor - 100 34th Ave, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA

And many others, but I don't see "Le Colonial" in the list. Let me try a different approach. Maybe "Le Colonial" isn't in this system under that exact name. Let me try typing "Colonial" instead to see if it appears under that.

Actually, let me step back and think about this differently. If Le Colonial isn't showing up in the system by any variation I've tried (Le Colonial, Le Colonial restaurant, Le Colonial San Francisco, 20 Cosmo Place), it's possible that:
1. Le Colonial isn't in this particular ride-sharing app's database
2. It might be listed under a different name
3. I might need to use a nearby landmark or address

Let me try typing "Colonial" to see if it shows up that way.

- "Le" (to see all locations starting with Le)
- "Colonial"

All of these returned "No results". Since the system appears to have a predefined list of locations and "Le Colonial" is not included, I need to try a different approach.

Looking at the available locations when I searched for "Le", I could see many places but no Le Colonial. Since I can't find Le Colonial specifically, I have a few options:

1. I could proceed with the booking using just the pickup location and see if there's another step where I can manually enter the destination
2. I could try to find a nearby location to Le Colonial
3. I should report that Le Colonial is not available in the system

Since the instructions say "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over", and Le Colonial specifically was requested, I should not substitute with a different location.

Let me try one more approach - perhaps I can proceed to the next step with just the pickup location filled in and see if there are other options.

Since this is a ride booking task and the exact destination "Le Colonial" is not available in the system, I should report this as infeasible. The system requires exact matches from its predefined location database, and "Le Colonial" is simply not included.
