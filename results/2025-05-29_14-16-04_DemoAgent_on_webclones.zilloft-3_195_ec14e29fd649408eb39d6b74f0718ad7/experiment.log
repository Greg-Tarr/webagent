2025-05-29 14:20:07,917 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! The tour request has been submitted and now there's an additional form asking for more details to help secure the preferred tour time. I can see:

1. "When are you looking to buy?" - with options for 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, 12+ months
2. "Do you have a signed Exclusive Agency Agreement with a real estate agent?" - with Yes/No options

The "Done" button is currently disabled, which means I need to answer both questions to complete the request.

I should select reasonable answers to complete this final step. Let me select:
1. "0-3 months" for the buying timeline (seems reasonable for someone requesting a tour)
2. "No, I haven't signed with an agent" (since this appears to be an individual request)

Then I can click Done to complete the tour request.

Now I need to answer the second question about whether they have a signed Exclusive Agency Agreement with a real estate agent. I'll select "No, I haven't signed with an agent." since that's the most common scenario for someone looking for homes.

Both questions have been answered and the Done button is now active. I can complete the tour request by clicking the Done button.
