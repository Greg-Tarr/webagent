2025-05-29 14:25:19,448 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to filter listings in San Jose to display only "Townhomes" within a price range of $750,000 to $1,000,000 and count how many results are displayed.

Looking at the current state, I'm on the Zilloft homepage. I can see:
1. A search textbox for "Search homes by address, neighborhood, city or ZIP code" (element [94])
2. A "Start search" button (element [96])
3. A "Browse available homes" button (element [129])

I need to first search for San Jose to get to the listings page, then apply the filters for property type (Townhomes) and price range ($750,000 to $1,000,000).

Let me start by searching for San Jose in the search box.

action:
fill(bid="94", value="San Jose")

1. The price filter is successfully applied - the button shows '$750K - $1M'
2. There are currently "8 results" shown in the search results
3. I can see 8 property listings displayed

However, I still need to apply the "Townhomes" filter to the "Home Type". Looking at the listings, I can see various types:
- Condo for sale (Santa Monica)
- House for sale (San Luis Obispo)
- Townhouse for sale (San Jose) - this one would qualify!
- House for sale (San Francisco)
- House for sale (San Jose)
- House for sale (San Diego)
- House for sale (San Diego)
- House for sale (San Francisco)

So I can see there's at least 1 townhouse in the current results (620 Almaden Walk Loop, San Jose, CA 95125 - "Townhouse for sale"), but I need to apply the Home Type filter to show ONLY townhomes.

Let me click on the "Home Type" filter button to set it to Townhomes.

action:
click(bid="990")

The page is currently loading the filtered results as indicated by the "Searching for results..." loading message. I need to wait for the results to load completely to see how many townhomes in San Jose are within the $750,000 to $1,000,000 price range.

2025-05-29 14:27:31,681 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The filtered results have loaded. Let me analyze what I can see:

1. The filters applied successfully:
   - Location: San Jose (in the search box)

   - Home type: "Home Type (1)" indicating Townhomes is selected

2. The results show:
   - "1 result" is clearly displayed
   - There is one property listing shown: "620 Almaden Walk Loop, San Jose, CA 95125"
   - Price: $950,000 (which is within the $750,000-$1,000,000 range)
   - Description: "- Townhouse for sale" (which confirms it's a townhome)
   - 3 beds, 3 baths, 1,425 sqft

So the task has been completed successfully. The filters have been applied correctly for:
- San Jose location
- Price range $750,000 to $1,000,000  
- Home type: Townhomes

And the result shows exactly 1 result.

Let me take a screenshot just to be sure before sending the final message, as recommended in the instructions.

2025-05-29 14:27:47,270 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I have successfully completed the task. Let me review what was accomplished:

1. I searched for "San Jose" in the search box
2. I applied the price filter to $750,000 - $1,000,000 (which shows as "$750K - $1M" in the interface)
3. I applied the Home Type filter to select "Townhomes" (which shows as "Home Type (1)" in the interface)
4. The results have been loaded and displayed

From the screenshot and the page state, I can clearly see:
- The search location is "San Jose"
- The price filter shows "$750K - $1M" 
- The home type filter shows "Home Type (1)" indicating one type is selected (Townhomes)
- The results clearly show "1 result" 
- There is one property displayed: "620 Almaden Walk Loop, San Jose, CA 95125" priced at $950,000, described as "3 bds | 3 ba | 1,425 sqft - Townhouse for sale"

This confirms that:
- The filters are correctly applied
- The property shown is indeed a townhouse (townhome)  
- The price ($950,000) is within the specified range ($750,000 - $1,000,000)
- The location is San Jose

The answer is clearly "1 result" as displayed on the page.
