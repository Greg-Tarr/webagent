I'm currently on the Zilloft homepage. I can see there's a search textbox that says "Search homes by address, neighborhood, city or ZIP code" and there's a "Start search" button. I should:

1. First, I need to search for San Francisco properties
2. Then filter for condos and price range under $300,000
3. Select a specific property
4. Request a tour

Let me start by searching for San Francisco in the search box.

Looking at the current search results, I can see we have 56 results for San Francisco, but I notice most of these properties are not actually in San Francisco - they're in various California cities like San Diego, Santa Ana, Modesto, Santa Clarita, etc. This suggests the search might be bringing up California-wide results.

However, I do see a few San Francisco properties:
- "1522 27th Ave, San Francisco, CA 94122" for $995,000 (House for sale)
- "1507 35th Ave, San Francisco, CA 94122" for $1,295,000 (House for sale)

But I need to find condos under $300,000 specifically. Let me look through the results more carefully for condos under $300,000:

Looking at the condos in the results:
- "914 Lincoln Blvd APT 103, Santa Monica, CA 90403" - $999,000 (Condo for sale) - too expensive
- "3950 Ohio St UNIT 230, San Diego, CA 92104" - $330,955 (Condo for sale) - over budget
- "503 N Santa Anita Ave APT G, Arcadia, CA 91006" - $1,498,000 (Condo for sale) - way over budget
- "3660 S Bear St #34, Santa Ana, CA 92704" - $359,900 (Condo for sale) - over budget
- "8085 Caminito De Pizza UNIT K, San Diego, CA 92108" - $550,000 (Condo for sale) - over budget


- "6350 Genesee Ave UNIT 107, San Diego, CA 92122" - $360,000 (Condo for sale) - over budget

I've discovered one potential option in San Marcos priced at $299,000, which meets the budget requirement. However, this property is not in San Francisco, which complicates my original search criteria. I'll need to investigate further to find a San Francisco condo that matches the specified budget constraints.

My next step involves strategically applying targeted filters to narrow down the property search. I'll focus on selecting specific parameters to isolate San Francisco condos under $300,000, systematically refining the search to match my precise requirements.

1. Properties in San Francisco (specifically)
2. Under $300,000

Looking at the results:

1. 914 Lincoln Blvd APT 103, Santa Monica, CA 90403 - $999,000 (too expensive and Santa Monica, not SF)
2. 3950 Ohio St UNIT 230, San Diego, CA 92104 - $330,955 (too expensive and San Diego, not SF)
3. 503 N Santa Anita Ave APT G, Arcadia, CA 91006 - $1,498,000 (too expensive and Arcadia, not SF)
4. 3660 S Bear St #34, Santa Ana, CA 92704 - $359,900 (too expensive and Santa Ana, not SF)
5. 8085 Caminito De Pizza UNIT K, San Diego, CA 92108 - $550,000 (too expensive and San Diego, not SF)
6. 6350 Genesee Ave UNIT 107, San Diego, CA 92122 - $360,000 (too expensive and San Diego, not SF)
7. 3427 Capalina Rd APT 22, San Marcos, CA 92069 - $299,000 (Under $300k but San Marcos, not SF)
8. 310 E San Jose Rd UNIT 110, Palm Springs, CA 92264 - $319,000 (too expensive and Palm Springs, not SF)
9. 5264 Beachfront Cove St #218, San Diego, CA 92154 - $575,000 (too expensive and San Diego, not SF)
10. 2832 Lyon St, San Francisco, CA 94123 - $1,980,000 (too expensive but this IS in San Francisco!)


11. 1465 C St UNIT 3517, San Diego, CA 92101 - $465,000 (too expensive and San Diego, not SF)
12. 3431 Capalina Rd APT 20, San Marcos, CA 92069 - $399,000 (too expensive and San Marcos, not SF)

After a thorough review, the search results are disappointing. The single San Francisco property is astronomically priced at nearly $2 million, completely out of reach. While one property meets the budget requirement, it's located in San Marcos, not San Francisco. I'll need to refine my search criteria or expand my budget to find a suitable condo.

2025-05-29 14:30:33,074 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I can see the search results now. There is 1 result showing:
- "3427 Capalina Rd APT 22, San Marcos, CA 92069"
- Price: $299,000 
- 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, 762 sqft
- Listed as "Condo for sale"
- By EXCEL PREFERRED REALTY

However, I notice there's a problem here - this property is located in San Marcos, CA, not San Francisco as required by the goal. The goal specifically asks for "a property listed in San Francisco as 'Condos' within a price range under $300,000".

This means there are no condos in San Francisco under $300,000 available in the search results. I need to think about this carefully:

1. The search was for San Francisco
2. Filters were applied for condos and under $300,000
3. Only 1 result came back, but it's in San Marcos, CA, not San Francisco

This suggests that there are no condos available in San Francisco under $300,000. I should probably report that this goal is infeasible because there are no condos in San Francisco under $300,000 available.

But let me double-check - maybe I should verify that the search was really for San Francisco. Looking at the search box, it shows "San Francisco" in the textbox, and the filters show "Up to $300K" and "Home Type (1)" indicating condos are selected.

So it appears the search is correctly configured but there are simply no condos in San Francisco under $300,000 available. The one result showing is in San Marcos, CA, which is not San Francisco.

Given that the goal specifically requires a property "listed in San Francisco", and there are no such properties available under the criteria, I should report this as infeasible.

action:
report_infeasible(reason="There are no condos available in San Francisco under $300,000. The search returned only 1 result, but it's located in San Marcos, CA, not San Francisco as required. The goal specifically asks for a property \"listed in San Francisco\" which is not available within the specified price range.")
