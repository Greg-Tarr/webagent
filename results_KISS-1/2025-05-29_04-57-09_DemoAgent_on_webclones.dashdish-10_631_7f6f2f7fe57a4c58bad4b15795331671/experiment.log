2025-05-29 04:58:37,862 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see that both items have been successfully added to the cart. Looking at the cart tooltip, I can see:

- Souvla
- 2 items 
- Bacon Double Cheeseburger 1 x $11.65
- $31.65 total before taxes

Wait, I notice that the cart tooltip only shows the Bacon Double Cheeseburger but the total is $31.65, which suggests both items are in the cart. The first item (Medium Classic Cheeseburger for $14.01) + the second item (Small Bacon Double Cheeseburger for $11.65) would total $25.66, but the cart shows $31.65. This suggests there might be additional fees or taxes included.

Let me check my work:
1. ✅ I successfully added a Medium Classic Cheeseburger ($14.01)
2. ✅ I successfully added a Small Bacon Double Cheeseburger ($11.65)

Now I need to proceed to checkout to complete the order with Standard Delivery. I should click on "Go to Cart" to proceed with the checkout process.
