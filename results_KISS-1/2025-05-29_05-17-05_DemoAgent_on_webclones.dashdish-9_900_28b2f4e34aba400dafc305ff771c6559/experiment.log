2025-05-29 05:17:26,075 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to:
1. Find "RT Rotisserie" restaurant on the page
2. Add a "Large Classic Cheeseburger" to cart
3. Remove it from the cart

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the DashDish homepage. I can see several "RT Rotisserie" entries on this page:

1. One in the "Best of lunch" section - heading 821 "RT Rotisserie" with 4.8 rating, 500 ft, 27 min
2. One in "The Infatuation's picks" section - heading 1041 "RT Rotisserie" with 4.8 rating, 500 ft, 27 min 
3. One in "Most loved" section - heading 1573 "RT Rotisserie" with 4.8 rating, 500 ft, 27 min
4. One in "Most popular local restaurants" section - heading 2410 "RT Rotisserie" with 4.8 rating, 500 ft, 27 min

They all appear to be the same restaurant since they have identical ratings and distances. I should click on one of these to go to the restaurant page and look for the "Large Classic Cheeseburger".

Let me click on the first one I see.

action:
click(bid="821")

2025-05-29 05:17:37,325 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm now on the RT Rotisserie page. I can see the restaurant details and some menu items. I can see "Classic Cheeseburger" for $11.89 in the "Most Liked Items From The Menu" section, with an "Add" button next to it. But I need to find the "Large Classic Cheeseburger" specifically. 

The current page only shows a few popular items, but I need to see the full menu to find the "Large Classic Cheeseburger". I should scroll down or look for a menu section or full menu link. Let me scroll down to see if there's more content or a full menu.

action:
scroll(delta_x=0, delta_y=500)

2025-05-29 05:17:48,710 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm on the RT Rotisserie page and I can see a "Classic Cheeseburger" for $11.89, but I need to find the "Large Classic Cheeseburger" specifically. Let me look at what I can see:

1. Classic Cheeseburger - $11.89 - #1 Most Liked
2. Bacon Double Cheeseburger - $5.89 - #2 Most Liked  
3. Mushroom Swiss Burger - $19.06 - #3 Most Liked

I can see there are "Add" buttons next to each item. But I need to find the "Large Classic Cheeseburger" specifically. I should check if clicking on the "Classic Cheeseburger" item will show size options, or if I need to scroll down to see more menu items.

Let me try clicking on the "Classic Cheeseburger" to see if it opens an options page where I can select the "Large" size.

action:
click(bid="358")

2025-05-29 05:17:59,844 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I clicked on the "Classic Cheeseburger" but the page state didn't change. This means either:
1. The click didn't work properly
2. I need to click the "Add" button instead of the heading
3. There might be a delay or issue

Let me try clicking the "Add" button for the Classic Cheeseburger instead, as that's typically what you click to add items to cart. I can see there's an "Add" button with bid 355.

action:
click(bid="355")

2025-05-29 05:18:11,066 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I've successfully clicked on the Classic Cheeseburger and a customization modal opened. I can see:

1. The heading shows "Classic Cheeseburger"
2. There are size options with radio buttons:
   - Small • 230 cal
   - Medium • 320 cal • +$0.90
   - Large • 480 cal • +$1.60 (this one is already checked/selected!)

Great! The "Large" size is already selected, which is exactly what I need for the "Large Classic Cheeseburger". The price shows $13.49 for the large version.

Now I need to:
1. Add this Large Classic Cheeseburger to the cart by clicking "Add to cart $13.49"
2. Then remove it from the cart

Let me proceed with adding it to the cart first.

action:
click(bid="739")

2025-05-29 05:18:22,651 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see that the Large Classic Cheeseburger has been successfully added to the cart. I can see in the header area there's a cart button showing "1" and there's a tooltip that shows:

"RT Rotisserie 1 items Classic Cheeseburger Classic Cheeseburger 1 x $13.49 Go to Cart Continue $19.48 total before taxes"

This confirms that:
1. The item is from RT Rotisserie ✓
2. It's a Classic Cheeseburger ✓ 
3. It's 1 item for $13.49 (which was the Large size) ✓
4. It's in the cart ✓

Now I need to remove it from the cart. I can see there's a "Go to Cart" button in the tooltip. Let me click on that to access the cart and then remove the item.

action:
click(bid="753")
