2025-05-29 05:19:10,798 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me understand the goal: I need to find the earliest available flight from Savannah to Albuquerque on December 1st, 2024.

Looking at the current state, I can see this is an airline booking website (Airlines Airways). I can see the booking form with fields for:
- From (Origin)
- To (Destination) 
- Dates
- Travelers
- Travel Class

I need to:
1. Set the origin to Savannah
2. Set the destination to Albuquerque
3. Set the date to December 1st, 2024
4. Search for flights
5. Find the earliest available flight

Let me start by filling out the origin field. I can see there's a combobox for "Origin" with bid 215.

action:
click(bid="215")

Now I need to set the date to December 1st, 2024. I can see there's a date field that says "Departure - Return" with textbox id 4866. I need to click on it to open the date picker and select December 1st, 2024.

Since this is asking for a one-way flight to find the earliest flight, I should also make sure the trip type is set to "One-way" instead of "Roundtrip". Let me check the current state - I can see there are radio buttons for trip type, and currently "Roundtrip" is checked. I should change this to "One-way" first.

I need to:
1. First change the year from 2025 to 2024

I've also had issues clicking on the dropdown options in the date picker. The date picker seems to be difficult to work with.

Let me try a different approach. Since I've successfully set up the origin (Savannah) and destination (Albuquerque) and changed it to one-way, perhaps I can try clicking "Find flights" without setting a specific date to see what happens, or maybe there's another way to approach this.

Actually, let me try clicking on the date field again to reopen the date picker and then try using keyboard navigation or a different approach.
