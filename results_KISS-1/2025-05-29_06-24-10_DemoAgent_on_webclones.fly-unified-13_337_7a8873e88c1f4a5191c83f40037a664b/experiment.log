1. I can see a calendar picker is open showing May 2025 and June 2025
2. I can see the form below with:
   - From: Austin AUS 
   - To: Jacksonville JAX
   - Trip type appears to be one-way
   - Dates field showing "Depart"
   - Travelers: 1 Adult
   - Class: Economy
   - Find flights button

I need to navigate to December 2024. I can see there are dropdown menus to change the month and year. I see "May" and "2025" dropdowns at the top of the calendar. 

I need to:
1. Change the year from 2025 to 2024
2. Change the month to December 
3. Select December 3rd, 2024
4. Then search for flights

Let me try a different approach. I can see the year dropdown shows "2025" and I need to change it to "2024". Let me look for the year selector in the state.

I can see in the state that it's currently showing "May 2024" and I need to get to "December". I can see there's a month dropdown that currently shows "May". Let me change it to December.

I can see:
[4899] combobox '' value='May', hasPopup='menu', expanded=False

Let me check what I have set up so far:
1. ✅ Trip type: One-way (changed from roundtrip)
2. ✅ Origin: Austin AUS 
3. ✅ Destination: Jacksonville JAX
4. ✅ Date: Dec 3 (December 3rd, 2024)
5. ⏳ Travelers: 1 Adult (already set)
6. ⏳ Travel Class: Economy (currently set, but I need to search for both Economy and Business Class)

Now I need to search for flights. The current travel class is set to "Economy" which I can see in the form. I should first search for Economy flights, then come back and search for Business Class flights to compare the prices.

Let me click "Find flights" to search for Economy flights first.

action:
click(bid="292")

2025-05-29 06:26:34,323 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 06:26:34,422 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see that I've successfully gotten to the flight search results page for a one-way flight from Austin (AUS) to Jacksonville (JAX) on December 3rd, 2024. 

The page is showing multiple flights with different fare types, and I can clearly see the pricing for both Economy and Business Class seats. Let me analyze what I can see:

For the 8:00 AM departure flight specifically (which matches the user's requirement of "departing at 8:00 AM"), I can see:

Flight 1: 8:00 AM - 12:55 PM (4h 55m)
- Economy: $270 
- Business: $470

The user asked for the price difference between Business Class and Economy Class for the 8:00 AM departure, so:
Business Class ($470) - Economy Class ($270) = $200

But let me double-check by looking at all the flights to make sure I have the correct 8:00 AM flight:

Looking at the flight details, I can see:
1. Flight 1: 8:00 AM - 12:55 PM (4h 55m) - Economy $270, Business $470
2. Flight 2: 10:00 AM - 1:03 PM (3h 3m) - Economy $189, Business $389  
3. Flight 3: 12:00 PM - 3:51 PM (3h 51m) - Economy $253, Business $453
4. Flight 4: 2:00 PM - 6:58 PM (4h 58m) - Economy $213, Business $413
5. Flight 5: 4:00 PM - 6:04 PM (2h 4m) - Economy $245, Business $445

The first flight departing at 8:00 AM has:
- Economy: $270
- Business: $470
- Price difference: $470 - $270 = $200
 
The details align perfectly with the traveler's specific flight requirements, confirming the pricing and timing for the 8:00 AM departure.

2025-05-29 06:26:46,220 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see the flight results clearly now. Looking at the screenshot and the page state, I have the exact information I need:

For the flight departing at 8:00 AM from Austin (AUS) to Jacksonville (JAX) on December 3rd, 2024:

- Economy Class: $270
- Business Class: $470

The price difference would be: $470 - $270 = $200

The screenshot confirms this information is accurate. I can see the flight details clearly:
- 8:00 AM departure, 12:55 PM arrival
- 4h 55m flight time
- 0 STOP (nonstop flight)
- Economy: $270
- Business: $470

This matches perfectly with what the user was asking for - the 8:00 AM departure time flight, and I have both Economy and Business class prices.

I should provide the final answer now.
