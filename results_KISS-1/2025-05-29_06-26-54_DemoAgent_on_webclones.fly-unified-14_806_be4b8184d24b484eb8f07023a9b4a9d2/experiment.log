3. I need to navigate backwards to December 2024

Let me try a different approach. I should use the "Previous Month" button to navigate backwards from May 2025 to December 2024. That would be:

2025-05-29 06:29:58,700 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm having trouble with the date picker dropdown elements not being visible when trying to click them. I've tried multiple times to select 2024 from the year dropdown, but it keeps timing out saying the element is not visible. 

Let me think about this differently. I have:
- Origin: Indianapolis IND ✓
- Destination: Boise BOI ✓ 
- Trip type: One-way ✓
- Date: Need December 5th, 2024 (currently showing Feb 26)

The date picker interface seems to be problematic. Let me try a different approach. Instead of struggling with the complex date picker, maybe I should try to proceed with the current date and see if I can change it later, or try a completely different approach.

Actually, let me take a screenshot first to see the current state and maybe try using mouse coordinates to select the 2024 option.

action:
take_screenshot()

2025-05-29 06:30:10,443 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I can see the date picker is open and I can see the dropdown showing "2025" in the year field. I can see in the screenshot that I need to change the year from 2025 to 2024. I can see the dropdown is open at the top of the date picker. Let me try clicking on the "2025" dropdown to see if I can select 2024.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see:
- The date picker is open
- It's showing February 2025 and March 2025
- There's a dropdown showing "2025" which I need to change to 2024
- I need to get to December 2024

I can see there are dropdown menus - one for month ("February") and one for year ("2025"). I need to click on the year dropdown first.

Looking at the current state, I can see the form has:
- Origin: Indianapolis IND ✓
- Destination: Boise BOI ✓ 
- Date: Feb 26 (wrong - I need Dec 5, 2024)
- Travelers: 1 Adult ✓
- Class: Economy ✓

Since I'm having so much trouble with the date picker, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can clear the date field and type directly, or try to use keyboard navigation. But first, let me see if I can just proceed with the current settings and modify the date later during the booking process.

Actually, let me try one more approach. Instead of fighting with the dropdown elements, let me try to navigate directly to December 2024 by clicking the month dropdown first and then changing to December, and then dealing with the year.

Let me think about a different approach. Maybe I should try to close the current date picker and try a different method. Or maybe I should refresh the page and start over with a simpler approach.

Actually, let me try using mouse coordinates to click on "December" since I can see it in the dropdown that's currently open.

2. Destination: Boise BOI ✓  
3. Trip type: One-way ✓
4. Date: Currently shows "Feb 26" but I need December 5th, 2024

The date picker interface is proving problematic. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should try to refresh the page and start over, or try going back to the home page and start fresh. The important requirement here is December 5th, 2024, and I'm stuck in February 2025.

Actually, let me try closing the date picker and try a different approach. Maybe I can close it by clicking elsewhere and then try again, or use a different method.

Actually, let me try to click somewhere else to close the date picker first, then try to reopen it and see if I get a different behavior.

2025-05-29 06:31:06,975 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I see the date picker closed and now a travelers dropdown opened. The date field still shows "Feb 26" but I need December 5th, 2024. Let me close this travelers dropdown by clicking elsewhere and try a different approach to set the date.

Actually, looking at my progress:
- ✅ Trip type: One-way selected
- ✅ Origin: Indianapolis IND selected
- ✅ Destination: Boise BOI selected  
- ❌ Date: Shows Feb 26 but I need Dec 5, 2024
- ✅ Travelers: 1 Adult (correct)
- ✅ Class: Economy (correct by default)

The date picker is being very problematic. Given that I've tried multiple approaches with the date picker and it's not working properly, let me try a different strategy. Maybe I should just proceed with the search with the current date and see if I can modify it later, or try refreshing the page to start over with a different approach.

However, the instructions are very clear that "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over". Since the date is wrong (Feb 26 instead of Dec 5, 2024), I should not proceed.

Let me try refreshing the page to start over with a cleaner state.

However, maybe I can just proceed with the search with whatever date it has and see if the system allows me to modify it later, or I can refresh the page and try again.

Actually, looking at the situation, I've been struggling with the date picker for a while. Let me refresh the page and try a completely different approach. The date picker interface seems to have some issues with the dropdown selections.

Let me review what I have so far:
- Trip type: One-way ✓
- Origin: Indianapolis IND ✓  
- Destination: Boise BOI ✓
- Date: Dec 5 ✓

Now I need to:
1. Set the number of travelers (it currently shows "1 Adult" which seems correct)
2. Make sure the travel class is set to Economy
3. Submit the search to find flights

The user wants:
- A one-way flight from Indianapolis (IND) to Boise (BOI)
- On December 5th, 2024
- Departing at the first time in the morning 
- Economy class
- The closest window seat to the front of the plane

I can see the travel class field shows "Economy" so that should be correct. Let me check the travelers and class settings, then search for flights.

   - To: Boise BOI  
   - Date: Dec 5
   - Travelers: 1 Adult
   - The URL confirms it's searching for Economy class and the date is December 5th, 2024

Since it's still loading, I should wait for the flight results to appear. Let me wait a moment and then check the page state to see if the flights have loaded.

I need to remember my goal: find the closest window seat to the front of the plane for the first morning departure in Economy class.

Let me wait for the page to finish loading.

1. **8:00 AM - 12:31 PM** (4h 31m, 0 stops) - This is the EARLIEST MORNING FLIGHT
2. 10:00 AM - 12:53 PM (2h 53m, 0 stops) 
3. 2:00 PM - 4:49 PM (2h 49m, 0 stops)

According to the goal, I need to find "the first time in the morning in Economy class". The 8:00 AM departure is clearly the earliest morning flight.

For the 8:00 AM flight, the Economy class fare is $226. I need to select the Economy fare (not Basic Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First) since the goal specifically asks for Economy class.

I should select the Economy fare for the 8:00 AM flight. Let me click on "Select Economy fare for $225.29" or the "$226 Economy" button.

2025-05-29 06:39:05,242 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I now have access to the seat map for the flight. Let me analyze what I can see:

**Flight Details Confirmed:**
- Date: Thu, Dec 5, 2024 ✓
- Flight: UA969 ✓
- Aircraft: Boeing 777-200 ✓
- Duration: 4h 31m ✓
- Route: Indianapolis to Boise ✓

**Seat Map Analysis:**
I can see the seat map with rows 1-10 visible. The aircraft has a 3-3 configuration:
- Columns A, B, C on the left side
- Columns D, E, F on the right side
- A and F are window seats
- The front of the plane starts at row 1

**Available vs Unavailable seats:**
- Rows 1-2: All seats are disabled (likely First Class - unavailable for Economy)
- Row 3: 3A (window) - available, 3B - unavailable, 3C - available, 3D - available, 3E - available, 3F (window) - unavailable
- Row 4: 4A (window) - available, 4B - available, 4C - available, 4D - available, 4E - unavailable, 4F (window) - available
- Row 5: 5A (window) - available, 5B - available, 5C - available, 5D - available, 5E - unavailable, 5F (window) - available
- Row 6: 6A (window) - available, 6B - available, 6C - available, 6D - unavailable, 6E - available, 6F (window) - available
- Row 7: 7A (window) - available, 7B - available, 7C - available, 7D - unavailable, 7E - available, 7F (window) - available


- Row 8: 8A (window) - available, 8B - available, 8C - available, 8D - unavailable, 8E - available, 8F (window) - available
- Row 9: 9A (window) - available, 9B - available, 9C - unavailable, 9D - available, 9E - available, 9F (window) - available
- Row 10: 10A (window) - available, 10B - available, 10C - unavailable, 10D - unavailable, 10E - unavailable, 10F (window) - available

Continuing my seat analysis, I notice a pattern of seat availability. Most window seats remain open, with some middle and aisle seats blocked. Rows 8-10 show consistent availability, particularly for window and some middle seats. The seat map reveals strategic blocking, potentially for social distancing or passenger comfort.

I'll prioritize the front window seats. Scanning the list, Seat 3A emerges as the optimal choice - it's the earliest available window seat, positioned closest to the plane's front section. This location offers maximum convenience and early boarding advantage.

I'm selecting Seat 3A.

click(bid="6508")

2025-05-29 06:39:19,719 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 06:39:19,787 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see that seat 3A has been successfully selected. Looking at the state changes:

1. The traveler button now shows "3A" and "$152.99" indicating the seat has been selected
2. The seat 3A cell now shows "Seat 3A selected" with a pressed button
3. The subtotal changed from "$0.00" to "$152.99"

This confirms that I have successfully found and selected the closest window seat to the front of the plane - seat 3A. 

Let me double-check my analysis:
- Rows 1-2 are unavailable (disabled)
- Row 3 is the first available row 
- Seat 3A is a window seat (column A = left window)
- This is indeed the closest available window seat to the front of the plane

The task is complete. I should take a screenshot to verify and then send the final message to the user.

   - Column A (which is a window seat on the left side)
   
The screenshot clearly shows:
- "Greg Tarr 3A $152.99" - indicating seat 3A is selected
- The seat map shows seat 3A highlighted with a "1" (indicating it's selected for passenger 1)
- Rows 1 and 2 are marked with X's (unavailable)
- Row 3 column A is the first available window seat

I can also see from the seat map that:
- Columns A and F are the window seats
- Row 3A is indeed the closest available window seat to the front of the plane
- The aircraft is a Boeing 777-200
- Flight UA969 on December 5th, 2024

All requirements have been successfully met. I should now send the final message to the user with the results.
