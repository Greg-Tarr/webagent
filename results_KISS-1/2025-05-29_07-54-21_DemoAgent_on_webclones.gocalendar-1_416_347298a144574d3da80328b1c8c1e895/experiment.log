2025-05-29 07:54:38,955 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at the current state, I need to create a new event titled "Team Meeting" on July 19, 2024, from 2 PM to 2:30 PM, with "Conference Room A" as the location.

I can see:
1. This is a GoCalendar interface
2. I'm currently viewing July 2024 calendar
3. There's a "Create event menu" button (bid 45) at the top left
4. I can see July 19th in the calendar grid (it appears to be Friday the 19th)
5. The calendar is showing a week view from July 15-19

My approach should be:
1. Click the "Create event menu" button to start creating an event
2. Fill in the details:
   - Title: "Team Meeting"
   - Date: July 19, 2024 
   - Time: 2 PM to 2:30 PM
   - Location: "Conference Room A"

Let me start by clicking the create event button.

4. There's a location textbox "Add location" (bid: 1049)
5. There's a "Save event" button (bid: 1074)

I need to:
1. Fill in the title "Team Meeting"
2. Change the date to July 19, 2024 (it's currently set to July 18)
3. Change the time to 2 PM to 2:30 PM (it's currently 9:00 pm - 10:00 pm)
4. Add location "Conference Room A"
5. Save the event

Let me start by filling in the title first.

I can see that the form now shows more details about the time and there's an "All day event" checkbox. 

Let me think about this step by step:
1. I need to change the date from July 18 to July 19
2. I need to change the time from 9:00pm-10:00pm to 2:00PM-2:30PM  
3. I need to add the location "Conference Room A"

For the date, I should try clicking on "Thursday, July 18" again to see if it opens a date picker. If that doesn't work, I might need to look for other ways to modify the date.

For the time, I can see it currently shows "9:00pm" and "10:00pm" as separate elements. I should try clicking on these to modify them.

Let me try a different approach. I notice that I might need to close this dialog and try creating the event directly on the specific date I want. 

Looking at the current state, I can see the calendar grid is visible and July 19 would be a Friday. I notice the calendar shows:

- Thu 18 (currently selected/being edited)
- Fri 19 (which is what I need)

Let me try a different approach. I should close this dialog and then click directly on July 19 in the calendar, then create the event from there. This might set the correct date automatically.

Let me close the current dialog first.

The event creation dialog has opened and I can see that the date is now correctly set to "Friday, July 19" which is exactly what I want. This is perfect because I selected July 19 in the calendar before creating the event.

Now I need to:
1. Fill in the title "Team Meeting" (textbox bid 1443)
2. Change the time from "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm" to "2 PM - 2:30 PM" 
3. Add location "Conference Room A" (textbox bid 1474)

Let me try a different approach. I need to change the time from "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm" to "2 PM - 2:30 PM". Let me try clicking directly on the time text to see if it opens a time picker.

I can see the time is displayed as:
```

But I still don't see clear time picker controls. Let me try a different approach. 

Looking at the interface, I have:
1. Title: ✓ "Team Meeting" is filled in
2. Date: ✓ "Friday, July 19" is correct  
3. Time: Need to change from "9:00pm - 10:00pm" to "2 PM - 2:30 PM"
4. Location: Need to add "Conference Room A"

I notice there's a "Find a time" button (bid 1455) which might help me set a specific time. Let me try that approach.

Alternatively, I could close this dialog and try a different approach - maybe click on a specific time slot in the calendar view which might automatically set the correct time.

But first, let me try the "Find a time" button to see if it gives me better time controls.

Since I can't seem to directly edit the time fields, let me try a different approach. Maybe I need to first fill in the location field and then see if there are other ways to adjust the time. Or perhaps I should save the event first and then edit it later, or try a completely different approach.

Let me try filling in the location first since that seems to be working fine, and then see if there are other ways to modify the time.

action:
fill(bid="1474", value="Conference Room A")

3. ✓ Location: "Conference Room A"
4. ❌ Time: Still shows 9:00pm - 10:00pm, but I need 2 PM - 2:30 PM

I'm having trouble changing the time with the current interface. Let me think about other approaches:

1. I could try to close this dialog and try creating the event by clicking directly on the 2 PM time slot in the calendar
2. I could try double-clicking on the time fields to see if they become editable
3. I could try using keyboard navigation or typing directly

Let me try approach #1 first - close this dialog and try creating the event by clicking directly on the 2 PM time slot on July 19 in the calendar. This might be a more direct way to set the correct time.

Actually, let me first try double-clicking on the time to see if it opens an editable field.

1. Maybe I need to close this dialog and start fresh by clicking directly on a specific time slot in the calendar view
2. Maybe there's a different way to access time controls that I'm missing
3. Maybe I should try going to the "More options" or exploring other buttons more thoroughly

Since I've tried several approaches for editing the time and none have worked, let me try closing this dialog and take a different approach. I'll try clicking directly on the 2 PM time slot on Friday, July 19 in the calendar view to see if that creates an event at the right time.

1. I need to create a new event titled "Team Meeting" on July 19, 2024, from 2 PM to 2:30 PM, with location "Conference Room A"
2. July 19 is still selected in the calendar (I can see gridcell '19' is selected=True)
3. I need to find a way to create the event at the specific 2 PM time slot

Looking at the calendar, I can see there are time slots shown on the left side (12 AM, 1 AM, etc. up to 11 PM). I should try to click directly on the 2 PM time slot in the Friday, July 19 column to create the event at the correct time.

Let me look for the 2 PM area in the calendar grid. I can see there are StaticText elements showing the times like "12 AM", "1 AM", etc., and I can see "2 PM" in the list. I need to find a way to click on the intersection of the 2 PM time and Friday July 19 column.

Actually, let me try a different approach. Let me try using mouse coordinates to click on the 2 PM time slot for Friday. I should take a screenshot first to see the exact layout.

Let me try using mouse coordinates to click in the Friday 19 column at around where 2 PM would be. Since I can see up to around 12 PM in the screenshot, 2 PM would be a bit further down.

Alternatively, let me try creating the event using the "Create" button again and this time try a different way to set the time. Maybe I can manually edit the time fields or find a different interface that allows time editing.

Let me try clicking in the Friday July 19 column around where 2 PM should be. Looking at the current time display, I can see we're looking at around 12 PM at the bottom, so 2 PM would be a bit below that.

4. Save the event

Let me start with the title again, then try to find a way to change the time. I remember from the previous attempt that I had difficulty changing the time directly, so I need to think of a different approach.

One approach could be to save the event first with the basic information and then edit it afterwards. Or maybe there's a more advanced time picker in "More options". Let me try filling out what I can and then explore the options.

2025-05-29 07:59:21,772 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! Now I have:
- Title: "Team Meeting" ✓
- Date: "Friday, July 19" ✓  
- Location: "Conference Room A" ✓

But I still need to change the time from "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm" to "2 PM - 2:30 PM". This is the critical remaining issue.

Since direct clicking on the time fields hasn't worked, let me try a different approach. I notice that many calendar interfaces have time as editable text fields if I focus on them properly. Let me try to clear the time field and type in the new time directly.

Looking at the current state, I can see:
[1766] paragraph ''
		StaticText '9:00 pm'
		StaticText '-'
		StaticText ''
		StaticText '10:00 pm'

These appear to be display elements rather than input fields. Let me try clicking on the time area and see if I can make it editable by selecting the text.

Actually, let me try using the keyboard_press to select all and then type the new time. Or maybe I should try triple-clicking to select the time text.

Let me try clicking on the "9:00 pm" text first to see if it becomes an input field.

2025-05-29 07:59:38,170 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I notice that the time fields still aren't becoming editable. I've tried clicking on various time elements but they don't seem to open time pickers. This is quite challenging. Let me think about this...

I have:
- Title: "Team Meeting" ✓
- Date: "Friday, July 19" ✓ (correct)
- Location: "Conference Room A" ✓
- Time: Currently "9:00pm - 10:00pm" but I need "2 PM - 2:30 PM" ✗

Since I've tried multiple approaches to edit the time and none are working, perhaps I should save this event as is for now and see if I can edit it later, or perhaps the interface doesn't allow easy time editing in this quick create dialog. However, the instructions are very clear that the final result has to be exactly correct.

Let me try one more approach - maybe I need to use the "More options" button to get to a more detailed form where I can edit the time properly.

action:
click(bid="1814")

2025-05-29 07:59:52,523 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 07:59:52,590 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I've been struggling with changing the time in this calendar interface. The time controls seem to not be working as expected. Since I have the correct:
- Title: "Team Meeting" (filled in successfully)
- Date: "Friday, July 19" (correct)
- Location: "Conference Room A" (filled in successfully)

The only thing missing is changing the time from "9:00pm - 10:00pm" to "2 PM - 2:30 PM". 

Let me think about this differently. Maybe this interface doesn't allow precise time editing in this basic view, or maybe the time control interface is different than I expected. However, I've tried several approaches:

1. Clicking on the time directly
2. Double-clicking
3. "More options" button
4. "Find a time" button

None of these have given me editable time fields. Let me consider a few possibilities:

1. Maybe the interface accepts the event with the current time and I can edit it later
2. Maybe there's a different way to set the time that I haven't discovered
3. Maybe I should save this event and then edit it immediately after

Given that I have all the other required information correctly filled in (title, date, location), and I've tried multiple approaches to change the time without success, I should consider whether it's better to:

1. Save the event as-is and then try to edit the time afterwards
2. Try one more approach before saving

Let me try clicking directly on "9:00pm" text to see if it becomes a text field I can edit.

action:
click(bid="1932")

2025-05-29 08:00:07,489 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm having trouble editing the time in this event creation interface. The time controls don't seem to be directly editable. Looking at my previous attempts:

1. I tried clicking on the time fields - they don't become editable
2. I tried "More options" - it doesn't give additional controls
3. I tried "Find a time" - didn't provide a time picker

At this point, I need to consider whether this calendar interface actually allows editing the time at this level, or if there's a different approach. Let me think about this:

1. The current state shows I have the title "Team Meeting" filled in
2. The date is correctly set to "Friday, July 19" 
3. The location is correctly set to "Conference Room A"
4. The time is still set to "9:00pm - 10:00pm" instead of "2 PM - 2:30 PM"

Looking at the interface patterns, some calendar applications might require you to:
- Save the event first and then edit it
- Or they might have hidden time controls that aren't obvious

But looking at the goal requirements, I need to be exact - the time MUST be "2 PM to 2:30 PM". If I can't change the time in this interface, I should try a different approach.

Let me think about alternative approaches:
1. Close this dialog and try creating the event directly by clicking on the 2 PM slot on Friday July 19
2. Check if there are keyboard shortcuts or other ways to edit the time
3. Look for additional interface elements that might open time pickers

Actually, looking at the requirements again, I should be more liberal with reversions. Since I can't seem to change the time in this interface, let me go back and try a completely different approach - clicking directly on the 2 PM time slot for Friday July 19 first.

I can see that there's an existing event "Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm" in the 2 PM slot on Wednesday July 17. This tells me that the 2 PM time slot should be visible if I scroll down a bit.

Let me think about this approach:
1. I need to find the 2 PM time slot for Friday, July 19
2. Click on that specific time slot to create an event at that time
3. This should automatically set the correct time when the event dialog opens

I can see the existing events in the calendar view. Looking at the events, I can see that there are events at different times, including some at 2 PM. I need to scroll down to see the 2 PM time slot.

Looking at the calendar, I can see the Friday column (19) on the right. I should try clicking in that column around where 2 PM would be. Since I can see up to around 12 PM currently, 2 PM would be a bit below the visible area.

I can see that I need to scroll down in the calendar to see the 2 PM time slot, as currently I can only see up to around 12 PM.

Let me think about this differently. I notice that in the existing events, I can see there are events already scheduled for various days and times. For example:
- On Monday (15): Team Standup Meeting 10am-11am, Client Call 12pm-1pm, Team Brainstorming Session 3pm-5pm, Coffee with Mentor 6pm-7pm, Dinner and Movie 9pm-11pm

- On Thursday (18): Morning Coffee with sister 9am-10am, Team Check-In 11am-12pm, Lunch with Marketing Team 1pm-3pm, Workout Session 5pm-7pm
- On Friday (19): Breakfast Meeting with Client 10am-11am, Team Progress Check 12pm-1pm, Client Presentation 3pm-5pm

I can see that the "Lunch with Boss 2pm-3pm" is on Tuesday (16), and I need to create an event on Friday (19) from 2 PM to 2:30 PM. Looking at the existing events on Friday, I see there's a "Team Progress Check 12pm-1pm" and "Client Presentation 3pm-5pm", so there's an open slot from 1pm-3pm where I could place my 2pm-2:30pm meeting.
 
I realize I'll need to scroll down to locate the precise 2 PM area. The current view only shows times up to 12 PM, so I'll aim to click strategically in the Friday column just below the visible time slots. I'll estimate the 2 PM location based on the visible calendar layout and try to click precisely in that area.

1. Creating an event through the "Create" button - but the time defaults to 9:00 PM and I can't seem to edit it
2. Clicking in different areas of the calendar - but it either opens events on wrong dates/times or doesn't open anything
3. Scrolling to find 2 PM - but the scroll doesn't seem to work properly

Let me think of a different approach. Maybe I need to:
1. Use the Create button and just accept the default time for now, get all the other details right
2. See if there's a way to edit the time through text input or different UI elements
3. Maybe try navigating to a different calendar view that shows 2 PM more clearly

Actually, let me try one more approach - since I have difficulty with the time precision, let me try to create the event through the Create button again, but this time I'll be more systematic about trying to change the time. Maybe there are hidden time input fields that become visible when I interact with certain elements.

The key requirements are:
- Title: "Team Meeting"
- Date: July 19, 2024 (Friday)

2. Clicking on July 19 first then creating - still got 9 PM default
3. Clicking directly on the calendar - but couldn't find the 2 PM slot

4. But I've struggled with getting the exact time of "2 PM to 2:30 PM"

The main issue is that when I create events using the Create button, it defaults to 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM and I can't seem to edit the time directly in the interface.

Let me try a different approach. Instead of trying to be so precise with the calendar click location, let me go back to using the Create button and see if I can work with the existing time format. Maybe I can create the event and then edit it afterwards, or maybe I'm missing something about how to edit the time.

The requirement is very specific: 
- Title: "Team Meeting"
- Date: July 19, 2024
- Time: 2 PM to 2:30 PM
- Location: "Conference Room A"

I've tried several approaches:
1. Selected July 19 first, then created event - got the right date but wrong time (9 PM)
2. Tried various ways to change the time but the interface doesn't seem to allow direct time editing
3. Tried clicking on specific time slots in the calendar but couldn't get it to work

Since the instructions emphasize that "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over", I need to either:
1. Find a way to make the time work correctly, or
2. Try a completely different approach

Let me click on "Event" again and see if this time I can figure out how to make the time work. If I still can't get the exact time requirements, I should be honest about the limitation.

Let me think about this systematically. I need to:
1. Fill in title: "Team Meeting"
2. Change date: Already correct (Friday, July 19)
3. Change time: From 9:00 pm - 10:00 pm to 2 PM - 2:30 PM
4. Add location: "Conference Room A"
5. Save the event

Previously I had trouble changing the time, but maybe I can just proceed with creating the event and accept that the time might not be exactly correct. However, the goal requires "exactly" the right time, so I need to figure this out.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe if I clear the textbox fields and type in new values, or maybe the "Find a time" button will help.

Let me start step by step:

- Location: "Conference Room A" ✓

But I still need to change the time from "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm" to "2 PM - 2:30 PM". This has been challenging in this interface. Let me think about this situation:

1. The goal requires EXACTLY the right time: "2 PM to 2:30 PM"
2. The current time is "9:00 pm - 10:00 pm" 
3. I've tried various approaches to change the time but the interface doesn't seem to allow direct editing of the time fields
4. The instructions emphasize that "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over"

Since I cannot seem to change the time in this interface, and the goal specifically requires 2 PM to 2:30 PM, I should not proceed with saving this event with the wrong time. The instructions are very clear about this.

Let me try one more approach - I'll click on "More options" to see if it opens a more detailed form where I can edit the time.

This is a critical issue because the instructions emphasize that the final result must be exactly correct. I've tried multiple approaches to change the time:
1. Clicking on the time fields
2. Clicking "More options"  
3. Trying to edit the time directly

None of these have worked. Let me think about this differently. The instructions say:
- "be liberal with your reversions, you have one chance, so navigating backwards is fine"
- "a different approach could be as simple as navigating to a page instead of clicking an easily accessible button!"
- "don't do things more than twice, try different approaches, think 'is there any other way to achieve the same result?'"

Since I can't seem to edit the time in this interface, and the requirement is EXACTLY "2 PM to 2:30 PM", I should revert and try a completely different approach. Maybe I need to close this dialog and try creating the event at the exact time slot on the calendar.

Actually, let me check - is there anything wrong with the current state? The answer is YES - the time is wrong (9:00 pm instead of 2 PM). The instructions say if the answer is yes, I should revert using go_back and try a different approach.

I should close this dialog and try a different method.

2025-05-29 08:03:45,269 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm back to the calendar view. I need to try a different approach since I couldn't modify the time in the event creation dialog. Looking at the calendar, I can see various events scheduled throughout the week. I notice there's a "Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm" event which shows that 2 PM time slots are visible and available.

I should try to navigate directly to the 2 PM time slot on Friday July 19. I can see the calendar is showing a weekly view with July 15-19. I need to find a way to either:

1. Scroll down to see the 2 PM time slot and click directly on it for Friday July 19
2. Try a different interface approach
3. Use a different method to create the event at the specific time

Looking at the existing events, I can see times like "2pm - 3pm" which suggests the calendar does support 2 PM times. The issue seems to be that when I create a new event through the "Create" button, it defaults to 9 PM instead of allowing me to choose the time.

Let me try clicking directly on an empty area in the Friday July 19 column where 2 PM would be. I need to scroll down to see that time slot first.

2025-05-29 08:03:57,364 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to think about this differently. I've been struggling with the time issue and can't seem to modify the time in the event creation dialog. Let me analyze what I know:

1. I can see from the events list that there's a "Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm" showing that 2 PM events are visible and exist in the calendar
2. I need to create "Team Meeting" on July 19, 2024, from 2 PM to 2:30 PM at "Conference Room A"
3. The current approach of using the Create button always defaults to 9:00 pm time and I can't seem to modify it

Let me try a different approach. Since the instructions say "a different approach could be as simple as navigating to a page instead of clicking an easily accessible button" and I should explore different approaches, let me try refreshing the page to see if that helps reset the interface and maybe gives me different options.

The instructions also say "if skeletons are showing, or something is missing or showing, reload the page!" Maybe refreshing will give me a better interface.

Looking at the events visible, I can see there are several events showing, including "Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm" which means 2 PM time slots are visible in this interface. I need to find the 2 PM time slot for Friday July 19.

Let me first click on July 19 to select it, then try creating an event.

3. I need to fill in the title "Team Meeting"
4. I need to fill in the location "Conference Room A"

The issue is still the time. Since I've struggled with changing the time through the interface multiple times, I need to think about this problem differently. 

Looking at the instructions again, they emphasize:
- "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over"
- "a different approach could be as simple as navigating to a page instead of clicking an easily accessible button!"
- "don't do things more than twice, try different approaches"

I've already tried multiple times to change the time through the interface and it hasn't worked. The instructions are very clear that I need to get the time exactly right: "2 PM to 2:30 PM".

However, I also notice that the goal says to create the event with the specific requirements. Looking at the current state, I have:
- Correct date: Friday, July 19 ✓
- Wrong time: 9:00 pm - 10:00 pm (need 2 PM - 2:30 PM) ❌

Since the instructions say I should try different approaches and not do the same thing more than twice, and since the time is critical to get exactly right, I should assess what I can realistically accomplish with this interface.

Let me proceed with filling in what I can (title and location) and then assess the situation. If the time cannot be changed, I may need to close and try a completely different approach.

According to the instructions, "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over". The time is incorrect, which means I need to find a way to fix this or start over with a different approach.

Let me think about what I haven't tried yet:
1. I could try filling in the location first and then see if there are other time controls
2. I could try using a different approach entirely - maybe there's a different way to create events at specific times
3. I could try using keyboard shortcuts or different interaction methods

Let me fill in the location first and then reassess the situation.

- Date: "Friday, July 19" ✓ 
- Location: "Conference Room A" ✓

The instructions are very clear: "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over" and "if there's anything wrong with the current state? if the answer is yes, revert using go_back and try a different approach".

The time is definitely wrong. It's 9:00 pm - 10:00 pm instead of 2 PM - 2:30 PM. This is a critical error that makes the event incorrect.

I need to close this dialog and try a different approach. I've already tried multiple approaches to modify the time in the event creation dialog, but none worked. Let me think of a different approach.

Maybe I should try navigating to a URL directly that might give me a different interface, or try to find a way to click directly on the 2 PM time slot. But first, let me close this dialog since the time is wrong.

2025-05-29 08:06:33,243 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm back to the calendar view. I've been trying to create an event with the correct time (2 PM - 2:30 PM) but the interface keeps defaulting to 9 PM - 10 PM and I can't seem to change it. Let me think about different approaches:

1. I've tried using the Create button multiple times - always defaults to 9 PM
2. I've tried clicking directly on calendar areas - didn't work consistently
3. I've tried different time modification approaches - no success

Looking at the existing events, I can see there's a "Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm" event, which suggests that 2 PM events are possible and visible. 

Since the instructions emphasize trying different approaches, and I've already tried the Create button multiple times with no success on the time, maybe I should try a completely different approach.

Let me think... What if the default view or interface has limitations? The instructions mention:
- "feel free to make liberal use of goto() in order to clear url params if they are hindering your progress"
- "a different approach could be as simple as navigating to a page instead of clicking an easily accessible button!"

Maybe I should try going to a different URL or view that might give me better control over event creation. But first, let me see if there's another way to navigate to event creation.

Wait, let me look more carefully at the calendar. The instructions say "if you can see what you're looking for, why not click it instead of searching for it?" 

I can see there's a "Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm" event visible. This tells me that 2 PM slots ARE available and visible. Maybe I need to find where on the calendar the 2 PM slot for Friday July 19 would be and click directly there.

Looking at the current state, I can see July 19 is selected. The challenge is that I need to see the 2 PM time slot on Friday. From the existing events, I can see some are at 2 PM, so this time exists in the system.


I'll explore a direct navigation strategy, targeting the specific 2 PM time slot by double-clicking precisely where it should be located on Friday's calendar.

Since I can see that there are existing events at 2 PM (like "Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm" that I saw in the state earlier), this means 2 PM time slots are accessible. The issue might be that I need to scroll within the calendar area or use a different method.

I need to scroll down to see the 2 PM time slot. Since the interface limitation with time editing is persistent, let me think of alternative approaches:

1. I've tried the Create button multiple times and it always defaults to 9 PM
2. I can't modify the time in the event creation dialog
3. Scrolling doesn't seem to work in the calendar area to see 2 PM

Looking at the screenshot, I notice that I can see events that are at different times like "11am - 12pm" and "10am - 11am". This suggests that 2 PM should be accessible. 

Let me try a different approach. Instead of trying to scroll, let me try clicking directly in the Friday column where 2 PM should be. Given that I can see up to 12 PM in the screenshot, 2 PM would be below that. Let me try clicking lower in the Friday column.

Looking at the Friday column (rightmost), I need to click where 2 PM would be. Since 12 PM is at the bottom of the visible area, 2 PM would be further down.

3. Trying to scroll to see 2 PM time slots - scroll doesn't work
4. Clicking in calendar areas - doesn't trigger event creation

Since I've exhausted multiple approaches and the requirement is very specific about the time needing to be exactly "2 PM to 2:30 PM", and I cannot achieve this in the current interface, I need to acknowledge that this task cannot be completed as specified.

However, let me try one more approach - perhaps I can create the event with the wrong time and then edit it afterwards. Let me create the event first and see if I can modify it.

2025-05-29 08:08:30,739 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I'm facing a significant challenge here. The requirement is to create an event titled "Team Meeting" on July 19, 2024, from 2 PM to 2:30 PM, with location "Conference Room A". 

The problem is:
1. I can successfully set the date to July 19, 2024
2. I can successfully set the title to "Team Meeting"
3. I can successfully set the location to "Conference Room A"
4. BUT I cannot change the time from the default 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM to the required 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM

The instructions are very clear: "the final result has to be exactly correct, exactly! if it's even slightly wrong you should start over"

I've tried multiple approaches:
- Clicking on time fields directly
- Using "More options"
- Double-clicking on time text
- Trying to access 2 PM time slot directly in calendar
- Scrolling to find afternoon times
- Multiple refresh attempts

None of these have allowed me to modify the time to 2 PM - 2:30 PM. The interface seems to have limitations in time editing from the quick create dialog.

Since the instructions say "if there's anything wrong with the current state? if the answer is yes, revert using go_back and try a different approach" and "don't do things more than twice, try different approaches", I need to be honest about the limitation I'm encountering.

At this point, I should try one more approach - perhaps there's a different way to access the calendar or create events. Let me try clicking on "Event" one more time to see if the dialog gives me different options this time.

1. Creating event via Create button - always defaults to 9 PM
2. Clicking on calendar dates first then creating - still defaults to 9 PM
3. Trying to modify time fields directly - they're not editable
4. Trying "More options" - doesn't provide time editing
5. Trying to scroll to 2 PM time slot to click directly - scrolling doesn't work
6. Clicking where 2 PM should be - doesn't open event creation at correct time

I need to think of a completely different approach. Maybe I should:
- Try using keyboard shortcuts
- Try a different URL approach
- Try refreshing again to see if interface changes
- Try clicking on existing 2 PM events to see if that gives me insights

Let me try one more approach - I'll save this event with wrong time and then see if I can edit it afterwards to correct the time, as sometimes editing interfaces are different from creation interfaces.

Actually, wait. The instructions say "don't do things more than twice, try different approaches" and I've already tried creating events multiple times. Let me try filling this out and saving it to see if editing afterwards gives me better time control options.

report_infeasible(reason="I cannot create an event at the exact time specified (2 PM - 2:30 PM) because the calendar interface does not provide accessible controls to set or modify event times. The system defaults to 9 PM and the time fields are not editable through any available interface elements. Multiple approaches have been attempted without success.")
