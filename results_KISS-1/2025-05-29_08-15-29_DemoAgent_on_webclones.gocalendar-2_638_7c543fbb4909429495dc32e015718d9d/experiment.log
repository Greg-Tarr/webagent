2025-05-29 08:15:53,434 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me analyze the current state of the page and understand what I need to do.

The goal is to:
1. Switch to the "Month" view
2. List all events displayed for July 2024

Looking at the current state, I can see:
- I'm on a GoCalendar website (https://evals-gocalendar.vercel.app/calendar)
- There's a calendar grid for July 2024 visible with days from 1-31
- I can see there's a dropdown that currently shows "5 days" (element [182])
- I also see events listed for different days of the week

Currently, it appears I'm in a "5 days" view showing Monday July 15 - Friday July 19, as indicated by the text "July 15 – 19" and the dropdown showing "5 days".

I can see some events displayed in the current view:
- Team Standup Meeting (10am - 11am)
- Client Call (12pm - 1pm)
- Team Brainstorming Session (3pm - 5pm)
- Coffee with Mentor (6pm - 7pm)
- Dinner and Movie (9pm - 11pm)
- Morning Walk (9am - 10am)
- Team Workshop (11am - 12pm)
- Lunch with Boss (2pm - 3pm)
- Creative Session (4pm - 6pm)
- Project Sync (10am - 11am)
- Customer Feedback Session (12pm - 1pm)
- Team Collaboration Workshop (3pm - 4pm)
- Follow-up Meeting (5pm - 6pm)
- Dinner with Friends (7pm - 9pm)
- Reading Time (10pm - 11pm)
- Morning Coffee with sister (9am - 10am)
- Team Check-In (11am - 12pm)
- Lunch with Marketing Team (1pm - 3pm)


- Workout Session (5pm - 7pm)
- Breakfast Meeting with Client (10am - 11am)
- Team Progress Check (12pm - 1pm)
- Client Presentation (3pm - 5pm)

I notice additional events in the 5-day view that weren't previously captured. To fully view all July events, I'll need to switch to Month view and systematically list out the complete month's schedule.

The next step is to interact with the view dropdown and select "Month" to get a comprehensive overview of July 2024's events.

Looking at the calendar, I can see events listed for different days. I need to systematically go through the calendar and list all events I can see. I notice there's a "+2 more" button, which suggests there are additional events that aren't fully displayed. Let me first list what I can see, then check if I need to click that button to see more events.

From what I can see in the current state:

**July 15 (Monday):**
- Team Standup Meeting (10am - 11am)

**July 16 (Tuesday):**
- Morning Walk (9am - 10am)
- Team Workshop (11am - 12pm)
- Lunch with Boss (2pm - 3pm)
- Creative Session (4pm - 6pm)

**July 17 (Wednesday):**
- Project Sync (10am - 11am)
- Customer Feedback Session (12pm - 1pm)
- Team Collaboration Workshop (3pm - 4pm)
- Follow-up Meeting (5pm - 6pm)

**July 18 (Thursday):**
- Morning Coffee with sister (9am - 10am)
- Team Check-In (11am - 12pm)
- Lunch with Marketing Team (1pm - 3pm)
- Workout Session (5pm - 7pm)

**July 19 (Friday):**
- Breakfast Meeting with Client (10am - 11am)
- Team Progress Check (12pm - 1pm)
- Client Presentation (3pm - 5pm)

I also see these events that appear to be overlapping or additional:
- Client Call (12pm - 1pm)
- Team Brainstorming Session (3pm - 5pm)


- Coffee with Mentor (6pm - 7pm)
- Dinner and Movie (9pm - 11pm)

I'll investigate the "+2 more" button to uncover any hidden events on the calendar.

I can see the page now shows "Wednesday Jul 17" which indicates I'm now looking at a specific day view rather than the month view. I need to go back to the month view to properly list all events for July 2024.

Let me go back to get the month view again, and then I'll be able to compile the complete list of events from what I saw in the month view before.

From what I saw in the month view before clicking "+2 more", I was able to see many events across different days. Let me go back and get the month view again to make sure I capture all the events properly.

I can see many events displayed in the month view. Let me carefully go through and list all the events I can see:

Looking at the events displayed, I can see:

Week 1 (July 1-6): No events visible
Week 2 (July 7-13): No events visible  
Week 3 (July 14-20): Many events visible
Week 4 (July 21-27): No events visible
Week 5 (July 28-31): No events visible

For the week of July 14-20, I can see the following events listed:

- Team Standup Meeting (10am - 11am)
- Morning Walk (9am - 10am)
- Project Sync (10am - 11am)

1. The header now shows "Wednesday Jul 17" instead of "July 2024"
2. The view has changed to a daily schedule view with hourly time slots (12 AM - 11 PM)
3. I can see only the events for July 17th:
   - Project Sync (10am - 11am)
   - Customer Feedback Session (12pm - 1pm)
   - Team Collaboration Workshop (3pm - 4pm)
   - Follow-up Meeting (5pm - 6pm)
   - Dinner with Friends (7pm - 9pm)
   - Reading Time (10pm - 11pm)

But I need to be in Month view to see ALL events for July 2024. I should go back to the month view. Let me use go_back to return to the month view and then provide the complete list based on what I observed earlier.

From my earlier observation of the month view, I saw many events listed. Let me go back to the month view first.

July 19 (Friday):
- Breakfast Meeting with Client: 10am - 11am

And I can see there's still more events because there's a "+2 more" button indicating there are 2 additional events for this week that aren't displayed.

Let me also check if there are any events in other weeks. Looking at the calendar structure, I can see:
- Week 1 (June 30 - July 6): No events visible


- Week 2 (July 7 - July 13): No events visible
- Week 3 (July 14 - July 20): Many events displayed, with "+2 more" indicating additional events
- Week 4 (July 21 - July 27): No events visible
- Week 5 (July 28 - August 3): No events visible

I'll investigate the hidden events by clicking the "+2 more" button to ensure I have a complete understanding of the week's schedule. This will help me capture any additional commitments that aren't immediately visible.

This is similar to what happened before. I need to go back to the month view to see all events for July 2024.

However, before I had the full month view displayed and I could see many events listed. Let me think about what I saw:

From the previous state before clicking "+2 more", I could see these events in the Month view for July 2024:

Friday July 19:
- Breakfast Meeting with Client (10am - 11am)

- Client Presentation (3pm - 5pm)

And there was a "+2 more" button suggesting there were additional events that weren't displayed.

- Customer Feedback Session (12pm-1pm)
- Team Collaboration Workshop (3pm-4pm)
- Follow-up Meeting (5pm-6pm)
- Dinner with Friends (7pm-9pm)
- Reading Time (10pm-11pm)

And there's a "+2 more" button indicating there are additional events that aren't fully displayed.
 
I'm curious about the hidden events. I'll carefully investigate the "+2 more" button, weighing whether clicking it might disrupt my current month view. My goal is to capture all events without losing the comprehensive overview I've already established.

I notice the events are primarily clustered in the July 14-20 week, with the "+2 more" button suggesting additional entries I haven't yet seen. The week breakdown reveals potential event locations across different date ranges, though most seem concentrated in that specific week.

Scanning the visible events from July 15-19, I recognize there might be more details waiting behind that button. I'll need a strategic approach to reveal these without losing my current context.

The events span professional meetings, personal interactions, and self-care activities - ranging from team standups and client calls to social dinners and reading time. Each day seems carefully structured with multiple scheduled interactions, demonstrating a balanced professional and personal calendar.

2025-05-29 08:19:53,543 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I see that clicking the "+2 more" button took me to a day view for Wednesday July 17th, which shows only that day's events. I can see the events for that specific day now:

1. Project Sync (10am - 11am)
2. Customer Feedback Session (12pm - 1pm)
3. Team Collaboration Workshop (3pm - 4pm)
4. Follow-up Meeting (5pm - 6pm)
5. Dinner with Friends (7pm - 9pm)
6. Reading Time (10pm - 11pm)

But I need to get back to the Month view to see ALL events for July 2024, not just July 17th. Let me go back to the month view so I can collect all events from the entire month.

I need to remember the events I saw earlier in the month view:

From what I saw before clicking the "+2 more" button, there were many events displayed for the week of July 14-20:

July 15 (Monday):
- Team Standup Meeting (10am - 11am)

July 16 (Tuesday):  
- Morning Walk (9am - 10am)
- Team Workshop (11am - 12pm)

- Morning Coffee with sister (9am - 10am)
- Team Check-In (11am - 12pm)
- Lunch with Marketing Team (1pm - 3pm)


- Workout Session (5pm - 7pm)

I continue tracking the additional events for the week, noting Friday's schedule includes a Breakfast Meeting with Client, Team Progress Check, and Client Presentation. Two more events catch my eye: a Coffee with Mentor and a Dinner and Movie plan. I'm focused on returning to the month view to get a comprehensive look at July 2024's full calendar.

Let me navigate back to the GoCalendar website and then switch to Month view again. From what I saw earlier in the Month view, there were many events displayed, particularly in the week of July 14-20. I need to document all the events I saw before:

From the Month view, I saw these events:

- Dinner and Movie (9pm - 11pm)

And then when I clicked "+2 more" and went to the day view for July 17th, I saw these additional events for that day:
- Project Sync (10am - 11am)


I'm noticing additional events that require careful tracking. I'll verify the complete schedule by returning to the Month view to ensure I capture all July 2024 events comprehensively. The new events include a mix of professional meetings and personal activities, spanning different times of the day.

I'll quickly dismiss the popup and navigate to the monthly calendar view to get a comprehensive look at my schedule.

I can see many events displayed for the month, particularly concentrated in the week of July 14-20. I notice there's a "+2 more" button, which indicates there are additional events not fully displayed in that week.

Let me carefully analyze all the events I can see displayed in the month view:

From the state, I can see the following events in July 2024:

**July 15 (Monday):**
- Team Standup Meeting (10am - 11am)
- Client Call (12pm - 1pm)
- Team Brainstorming Session (3pm - 5pm)
- Coffee with Mentor (6pm - 7pm)
- Dinner and Movie (9pm - 11pm)

**July 16 (Tuesday):**
- Morning Walk (9am - 10am)
- Team Workshop (11am - 12pm)
- Lunch with Boss (2pm - 3pm)
- Creative Session (4pm - 6pm)

**July 17 (Wednesday):**
- Project Sync (10am - 11am)
- Customer Feedback Session (12pm - 1pm)
- Team Collaboration Workshop (3pm - 4pm)
- Follow-up Meeting (5pm - 6pm)
- Plus there's a "+2 more" button indicating additional events

**July 18 (Thursday):**
- Morning Coffee with sister (9am - 10am)
- Team Check-In (11am - 12pm)
- Lunch with Marketing Team (1pm - 3pm)
- Workout Session (5pm - 7pm)

**July 19 (Friday):**
- Breakfast Meeting with Client (10am - 11am)
- Team Progress Check (12pm - 1pm)
- Client Presentation (3pm - 5pm)


I'm intrigued by the "+2 more" button on July 17th, which suggests hidden events. The month view seems to have limitations in displaying all scheduled activities. I'll need to investigate these additional events carefully, wondering if they'll be fully revealed when I interact with the calendar view.

My previous exploration of the day view uncovered two specific events not initially visible: a social dinner and a personal reading session. These details complete the picture of that day's schedule, revealing more complexity than the month view initially suggested.

I can see the calendar is now displaying all events in a monthly format. Looking at the screenshot and the state information, I can see all the events for July 2024.

Let me carefully list all the events I can see:

From the state information, I can see the events are listed in the month view. Looking at the data, I can identify all the events for July 2024:

**July 15 (Monday):**
- Team Standup Meeting (10am - 11am)
- Client Call (12pm - 1pm)
- Team Brainstorming Session (3pm - 5pm)
- Coffee with Mentor (6pm - 7pm)

I notice there's a "+2 more" button for July 17th, which means there are additional events for that day that aren't fully displayed. 

I've identified the visible events spanning July 14-20, with most activities concentrated during weekdays. The current view reveals a partial month snapshot, highlighting busy daily schedules with multiple meetings, personal appointments, and professional engagements. The "+2 more" indicator suggests additional events are hidden from immediate view.
