2025-05-29 08:21:56,953 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to delete the event titled "Breakfast Meeting with Client" scheduled for July 19, 2024. Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on a calendar page and there are several events visible. 

Looking through the events, I can see one that matches what I'm looking for:
[954] button 'Event color indicator Breakfast Meeting with Client 10am - 11am'

This appears to be on Friday July 19th based on the column position. I can see that this event is scheduled for 10am - 11am.

The goal is to delete this specific event. I should click on this event first to see if there are options to delete it. Let me click on this event button.

action:
click(bid="954")

2025-05-29 08:22:06,959 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I successfully clicked on the "Breakfast Meeting with Client" event and now I can see the event details popup. The popup shows:

- Reminder: 15 minutes before
- Calendar: Work

I can see several action buttons available:
- Edit event

Since my goal is to delete this event, I need to click on the "Delete event" button (bid 1012).

Let me double check - is there anything wrong with the current state? No, this looks correct. I clicked on the right event and I can see the delete button clearly. The event details match what I was looking for - "Breakfast Meeting with Client" scheduled for July 19, 2024.

2025-05-29 08:22:26,711 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me look at the current state carefully. I need to delete the event titled "Breakfast Meeting with Client" scheduled for July 19, 2024.

Looking at the current calendar view (July 15-19), I can see various events listed for different days. Let me check for Friday (July 19) specifically to see if the "Breakfast Meeting with Client" event is still there.

I can see events for Friday July 19th:
- Team Progress Check 12pm - 1pm
- Client Presentation 3pm - 5pm

I notice that the "Breakfast Meeting with Client 10am - 11am" event that was previously shown at the bottom of the list (with bid 954) is no longer visible in the current state. This suggests that the deletion was successful!

Let me double-check by examining what events are currently shown for Friday July 19th:
1. Team Progress Check 12pm - 1pm (bid 967)
2. Client Presentation 3pm - 5pm (bid 980)

The "Breakfast Meeting with Client" event that was scheduled for 10am - 11am on Friday July 19th is no longer present in the calendar view. This indicates that the deletion was successful.

However, let me be very careful and thorough. I should verify this is correct. Let me look at all the events shown:

Monday 15:
- Team Standup Meeting 10am - 11am
- Client Call 12pm - 1pm
- Team Brainstorming Session 3pm - 5pm
- Coffee with Mentor 6pm - 7pm
- Dinner and Movie 9pm - 11pm

Tuesday 16:
- Morning Walk 9am - 10am
- Team Workshop 11am - 12pm
- Lunch with Boss 2pm - 3pm
- Creative Session 4pm - 6pm

Wednesday 17:
- Project Sync 10am - 11am
- Customer Feedback Session 12pm - 1pm


- Team Collaboration Workshop 3pm - 4pm
- Follow-up Meeting 5pm - 6pm
- Dinner with Friends 7pm - 9pm
- Reading Time 10pm - 11pm

Thursday 18:
- Morning Coffee with sister 9am - 10am
- Team Check-In 11am - 12pm
- Lunch with Marketing Team 1pm - 3pm
- Workout Session 5pm - 7pm

I confirm the "Breakfast Meeting with Client" is definitively removed from the calendar. The Friday July 19th schedule now only includes the Team Progress Check and Client Presentation, with no trace of the previously scheduled breakfast meeting.

action:
send_msg_to_user(text="The event titled \"Breakfast Meeting with Client\" scheduled for July 19, 2024 from 10am - 11am has been successfully deleted from the calendar. The event is no longer visible in the calendar view, confirming that the deletion was completed successfully.")
