2025-05-29 08:22:46,818 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to change the "Team Check-In" event on July 18, 2024, name to "Project Kickoff" and update the location to "Zoom". Let me carefully analyze the current page state.

Looking at the current state, I can see a calendar view for July 2024. I can see several events on different days. I need to focus on July 18th (Thursday). I can see that July 18th is currently selected (gridcell '18', selected=True).

I can see there is an event for July 18th called "Team Check-In" with the time "11am - 12pm":
[842] button 'Event color indicator Team Check-In 11am - 12pm'
	[851] paragraph ''
		StaticText 'Team Check-In'
	[852] paragraph ''
		StaticText '11am'
		StaticText '-'
		StaticText ''
		StaticText '12pm'

So I found the event I need to modify. I need to click on this event to open it and edit it. Let me click on this event button first.

action:
click(bid="842")

2025-05-29 08:22:55,591 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I can see that clicking on the "Team Check-In" event opened a popup with event details. I can see:

- Event name: "Team Check-In" 
- Date: July 18, 2024, 11:00am - July 18, 2024, 12:00pm
- Description: "Discuss team updates and challenges."
- Calendar: "Work"

I can see there's an "Edit event" button (bid 1012) that I can click to modify this event. I need to:
1. Change the name from "Team Check-In" to "Project Kickoff"
2. Update the location to "Zoom"

Let me click the "Edit event" button to open the editing interface.

action:
click(bid="1012")

2025-05-29 08:23:05,933 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I'm now in the edit mode for the "Team Check-In" event. I can see the edit form with the following key elements:

1. The title textbox [1078] currently has "Team Check-In" - I need to change this to "Project Kickoff"
2. The location textbox [1132] appears to be empty - I need to add "Zoom" here
3. There's also a Google Meet conference already set up, but the goal specifically asks to update the location to "Zoom", so I should focus on the location field

Let me proceed step by step:

1. First, I'll clear the title field and enter "Project Kickoff"
2. Then I'll add "Zoom" to the location field
3. Finally, I'll save the event

Let me start by clearing and updating the title field.

action:
clear(bid="1078")

2025-05-29 08:23:12,118 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Good! I successfully cleared the title field. Now I can see the textbox is focused and empty. I need to fill it with "Project Kickoff".

Then I need to fill the location field with "Zoom".

Let me proceed step by step.

action:
fill(bid="1078", value="Project Kickoff")

2025-05-29 08:23:20,689 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I've successfully changed the title from "Team Check-In" to "Project Kickoff". Now I need to update the location field to "Zoom". Looking at the current state, I can see there's a location field with bid 1132. Let me fill that with "Zoom".

Let me double-check the current state:
- Title has been successfully changed to "Project Kickoff" ✓
- Now I need to add "Zoom" to the location field (bid 1132)
- Then save the event

This looks correct so far. Let me proceed with filling the location field.

action:
fill(bid="1132", value="Zoom")

2025-05-29 08:23:32,862 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 08:23:32,878 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Excellent! I can see that I've successfully made both required changes:

1. ✅ Changed the title from "Team Check-In" to "Project Kickoff" - I can see the textbox now shows value='Project Kickoff' with StaticText 'Project Kickoff'
2. ✅ Added "Zoom" to the location field - I can see the textbox now shows value='Zoom' with StaticText 'Zoom'

Both changes are complete and correct. Now I need to save the event by clicking the "Save event" button. Let me double-check the current state:

- Title field (1078): Contains "Project Kickoff" ✅
- Location field (1132): Contains "Zoom" ✅
- Save event button (1080): Available to click

This looks perfect. I should now save the changes.

action:
click(bid="1080")

2025-05-29 08:23:43,041 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see that the event has been successfully saved and the page has redirected back to the calendar view. Looking at the calendar for July 18th (Thursday), I can now see that the event has been changed from "Team Check-In" to "Project Kickoff" and is showing on the calendar at 11am - 12pm.

I can specifically see this event in the calendar:
`[2017] button 'Event color indicator Project Kickoff 11am - 12pm'
[2026] paragraph ''
StaticText 'Project Kickoff'`

This confirms that:
1. ✅ The event name has been successfully changed from "Team Check-In" to "Project Kickoff"
2. ✅ The event is still scheduled for July 18, 2024 at 11am - 12pm
3. ✅ The changes have been saved and are now visible on the calendar

Let me click on the event to verify that the location has also been updated to "Zoom" to make sure both changes were applied correctly.
