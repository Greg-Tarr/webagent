2025-05-29 09:13:29,576 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to reschedule the "Morning Coffee with sister" event from July 18, 2024, at 9 AM to July 19, 2024, at 10AM using drag-and-drop functionality.

Looking at the current state, I can see the calendar is showing July 2024. I can see several events on different days, including on July 18th there's the "Morning Coffee with sister" event at 9am-10am (element ID 827).

I can see:
- The calendar is showing July 15-19 (5 days view)
- The "Morning Coffee with sister" event is on Thursday July 18 from 9am-10am (element 827)
- I need to move it to Friday July 19 at 10am-11am

I need to use drag-and-drop functionality. The event is in button element 827. I need to drag it from its current position to July 19 at 10am.

Let me first identify the current position of the event and the target position.

Current event: "Morning Coffee with sister" on July 18 at 9am (element 827)
Target: July 19 at 10am

I should use the drag_and_drop function with the event element (827) as the source and find the appropriate target element for July 19 at 10am.

Looking at the elements, I can see various time slots. I need to find the 10am slot on Friday July 19. 

But wait, I think I need to be more careful here. Let me analyze the structure. The calendar shows days Mon 15, Tue 16, Wed 17, Thu 18, Fri 19. The event "Morning Coffee with sister" is currently showing on Thu 18.

To drag and drop, I need to identify the target location for July 19 at 10am. Looking at the structure, I don't see explicit time slot elements for specific times on specific days that I can target. 


I'll capture a visual representation to better understand the layout and potential drag-and-drop zones.

2025-05-29 09:13:43,642 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Looking at the current state of the calendar page, I can see it's displaying July 2024. I need to reschedule the "Morning Coffee with sister" event from July 18, 2024, at 9 AM to July 19, 2024, at 10 AM using drag-and-drop functionality.

From the state, I can see:
- Currently viewing a 5-day calendar view showing July 15-19, 2024
- The current date selected is July 18 (shown as selected=True in gridcell '18')
- I can see the "Morning Coffee with sister" event listed as button [827] with text "Morning Coffee with sister 9am - 10am" on what appears to be July 18

The goal is to drag this event from July 18 at 9 AM to July 19 at 10 AM.

Looking at the calendar layout, I can see that there are column headers for different days:
- Mon 15, Tue 16, Wed 17, Thu 18, Fri 19

So July 18 is Thursday and July 19 is Friday.

I need to:
1. Find the "Morning Coffee with sister" event on July 18 at 9 AM
2. Drag it to July 19 at 10 AM

From the state, I can see the event button [827] with "Morning Coffee with sister" at "9am - 10am". I need to drag this to the 10 AM slot on Friday July 19.

Let me first locate the exact elements I need to work with. The event is at button [827]. I need to find where the 10 AM slot is on July 19 (Friday).

Looking at the time slots, I can see various time labels like "12 AM", "1 AM", etc., up to "11 PM". The 10 AM slot would be where I need to drop the event.

Let me use the drag_and_drop function to move the "Morning Coffee with sister" event from its current position to the 10 AM slot on July 19.

action:
drag_and_drop(from_bid="827", to_bid="219")

2025-05-29 09:13:55,830 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I attempted to drag and drop the "Morning Coffee with sister" event from July 18 at 9 AM to July 19, but I notice from the state that the event is still showing as "9am - 10am" and it's still button [827]. This suggests that my drag and drop operation may not have worked correctly.

Looking at the current state, I can see the event is now "focused" but it's still in the same position (July 18, 9am - 10am). I need to check if the drag and drop actually moved the event or if I need to try a different approach.

Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state and verify if the event has been moved or not.

take_screenshot()

2025-05-29 09:14:10,588 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me check the current state. I attempted to drag and drop the "Morning Coffee with sister" event from July 18 to July 19, but from the screenshot and state, it appears the event is still in the same position on July 18 at 9 AM. 

The drag and drop function returned "Success" but looking at the state, the event [827] is still showing "Morning Coffee with sister 9am - 10am" and it's still in the Thursday column (July 18). The state shows it's focused now, but it doesn't appear to have moved.

I need to try a different approach. Maybe I need to drag it to a more specific target - perhaps the exact time slot on Friday at 10 AM. Let me look at the calendar structure more carefully.

Looking at the page structure, I can see:
- [219] button 'Fri 19' - this is the Friday column header
- The calendar has time slots shown as StaticText elements (12 AM, 1 AM, 2 AM, etc.)

But I need to find the actual gridcell or time slot for 10 AM on Friday. The drag and drop to button [219] (which is just the day header) might not be specific enough.

Let me try a different approach. Instead of dragging to the day header, I should try to find the specific 10 AM time slot on Friday. Looking at the structure, I don't see specific browser IDs for the time slots, so maybe I need to use mouse coordinates.

Actually, let me first try clicking on the event to see if there's an edit dialog or some other way to modify it.

action:
click(bid="827")

2025-05-29 09:14:22,473 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 09:14:22,522 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see that clicking on the "Morning Coffee with sister" event opened an event popover with edit options. I can see:

1. The event is currently scheduled for "July 18, 2024, 9:00am - July 18, 2024, 10:00am"
2. There's an "Edit event" button that should allow me to modify the event details
3. The goal is to reschedule it to July 19, 2024, at 10AM using drag-and-drop functionality

Since the drag-and-drop didn't work in my previous attempt, let me try a different approach. I should close this popover first and try the drag-and-drop again, but this time I need to be more precise about where I'm dropping it.

Wait, the goal specifically says to use drag-and-drop functionality. Let me close this popover first and try the drag-and-drop again, but this time I need to target the 10 AM time slot on Friday (July 19).

Let me close this popover first.

action:
click(bid="1018")

2025-05-29 09:14:39,468 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 09:14:39,512 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Now I can see the calendar is back to the 5-day view showing July 15-19, 2024. I can see:

1. The "Morning Coffee with sister 9am - 10am" event is there on Thursday July 18, represented by button [827]
2. I can see the time slots clearly marked (12 AM, 1 AM, 2 AM, etc. up to 11 PM)
3. I can see Friday July 19 column represented by button [219] "Fri 19"

Now I need to drag the "Morning Coffee with sister" event from its current position (Thursday July 18 at 9 AM) to Friday July 19 at 10 AM.

Looking at the state more carefully, I need to find the specific target location for 10 AM on Friday. Let me examine the structure more carefully.

I can see that:
- [827] is the "Morning Coffee with sister" event on Thursday July 18
- [219] is the Friday July 19 day header
- But I need to find the specific 10 AM time slot on Friday July 19

Looking at the time slots, I can see they're listed as StaticText elements: '12 AM', '1 AM', '2 AM', etc. But I need to find the actual clickable/droppable area for 10 AM on Friday.

Looking at other events, I can see that Friday has:
- [954] button 'Event color indicator Breakfast Meeting with Client 10am - 11am' - this is already at 10 AM on Friday
- [967] button 'Event color indicator Team Progress Check 12pm - 1pm' - this is at 12 PM on Friday
- [980] button 'Event color indicator Client Presentation 3pm - 5pm' - this is at 3 PM on Friday

So there's already an event at 10 AM on Friday. But the goal is to reschedule to 10 AM, so maybe I need to place it at the same time slot or nearby.


I'll attempt to drag the event to the Friday day header to see what happens. This might reveal how the system handles event relocation or provide a clue about the correct dragging mechanism.

action:
drag_and_drop(from_bid="827", to_bid="954")

2025-05-29 09:14:54,584 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! Looking at the state changes, I can see that the drag and drop worked! 

The "Morning Coffee with sister" event has been successfully moved:
- It was originally on Thursday July 18 at 9am-10am (button [827] is no longer there)
- Now it appears as button [1169] "Event color indicator Morning Coffee with sister 10am - 11am"

This means the event has been successfully rescheduled from July 18, 2024, at 9 AM to July 19, 2024, at 10 AM (since it now shows as 10am-11am, which means it starts at 10 AM and is still a 1-hour duration).

The task is complete! The event has been moved using drag-and-drop functionality as requested. Let me take a screenshot to verify the final state visually before confirming completion.

2025-05-29 09:15:09,097 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! Looking at the screenshot, I can clearly see that the task has been completed successfully. I can see:

1. On Friday, July 19 (Fri 19 column), there is now a pink/red event showing "Morning Coffee with sister" that spans from 10 AM to 11 AM time slot
2. On Thursday, July 18 (Thu 18 column), I can see at the 9 AM slot there is no "Morning Coffee with sister" event - it's been moved

The drag and drop operation was successful. The "Morning Coffee with sister" event has been rescheduled from:
- **Original:** July 18, 2024, at 9 AM 
- **New:** July 19, 2024, at 10 AM

The task specifically asked to use drag-and-drop functionality, which I did successfully using the drag_and_drop function.

The visual confirmation in the screenshot shows:
- Friday (19) has "Morning Coffee with sister" at 10 AM (visible as a pink/red colored event)
- Thursday (18) no longer has this event at 9 AM

This matches exactly what was requested in the goal. The task is complete.
