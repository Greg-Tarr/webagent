2025-05-29 09:51:21,675 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to find out how many unread emails are in the Inbox. Currently I'm looking at the GoMail application which seems to be loading. I can see:

- A loading progress bar at 50%
- An animated logo for GoMail 
- A heading "GoMail Workspace"
- An alert area

It looks like the page is still loading. I should wait for it to finish loading or take a screenshot to see the current state better. Let me take a screenshot first to see exactly what's on the page.

action:
take_screenshot()

2025-05-29 09:51:35,866 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me examine the current state. I can see the GoMail application is loaded and I'm looking at the inbox. The user wants to know how many unread emails are in the Inbox.

Looking at the page, I can see:
1. The page title shows "Inbox (17) - fede.lopez@gmail.com"
2. In the navigation menu, there's a menuitem that says "Inbox menu item, 17 unread" with the text "Inbox" and "17"
3. I can also see there's a paragraph that says "1-50 of 54" which indicates we're seeing emails 1-50 of a total of 54 emails.

However, I need to be careful here. The question is specifically asking about UNREAD emails, not total emails. 

Looking at the title "Inbox (17)" and the navigation that shows "17 unread", this clearly indicates there are 17 unread emails in the inbox.

But let me also verify by looking at the email list itself. I can see many emails listed, but to determine which ones are unread, I would need to look at visual indicators. In typical email clients, unread emails are often bolded or have different styling.

Looking at the current state, I can see from multiple sources that there are 17 unread emails:
1. Page title: "Inbox (17)"
2. Navigation menu item: "Inbox menu item, 17 unread" with "17" displayed

The total number of emails in the inbox is 54 (as shown by "1-50 of 54"), but the unread count is clearly marked as 17.

This seems straightforward and I don't need to explore further since the unread count is clearly displayed in multiple places.

action:
send_msg_to_user(text="There are 17 unread emails in the Inbox.")
