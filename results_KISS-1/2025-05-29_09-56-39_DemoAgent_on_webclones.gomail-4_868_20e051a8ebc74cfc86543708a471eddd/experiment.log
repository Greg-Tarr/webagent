2025-05-29 09:56:53,273 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to navigate to the GoMail website and find the "Starred" category to count how many emails are in it. 

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the GoMail website (https://evals-gomail.vercel.app/) and there's a loading indicator showing with value 50. The page is still loading.

Let me wait for the page to fully load first, then explore to find the "Starred" category.

2025-05-29 09:57:14,911 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to find out how many emails are in the "Starred" category in GoMail. Looking at the current state, I can see:

1. I'm currently in the Inbox view, which shows "1-50 of 54" emails total in the inbox
2. I can see the navigation menu on the left side with options including:
   - Inbox (17 unread)
   - Starred
   - Snoozed
   - Sent
   - Scheduled
   - Drafts
   - More

3. In the current email list, I can see some emails that have stars - I can identify starred emails by looking for buttons that say "Remove star from email" (which means they are currently starred) vs "Add star to email" (which means they are not starred).

Looking through the visible emails, I can see several emails with "Remove star" buttons, indicating they are starred:
- Support email "Your Account Statement is Ready" (button ID 215)
- Noreply email "Live Stream Alert: Your Favorite Streamer is Now Live" (button ID 359)
- Jane Smith email "Project Update: Deadline Extended" (button ID 375)
- No Reply email "Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository" (button ID 407)
- Calendar Notifications email "Reminder: Team Sync-Up at 10:00 AM" (button ID 535)
- Support email "Payment Received: $100 from John Doe" (button ID 551)
- No Reply email "Your Files Have Been Successfully Synced" (button ID 679)
- Marketing email "New Features Added to Adobe Photoshop" (button ID 695)
- Alerts email "Suspicious Activity Detected on Your Account" (button ID 727)
- Newsletter email "Breaking News: Election Results Are In" (button ID 775)
- Support email "Action Required: Security Patch Update Available" (button ID 839)


- Newsletter email "New Leadership Articles You Can't Miss" (button ID 999)

I realize the current view only shows a partial list of starred emails. To get a comprehensive count, I'll navigate to the dedicated Starred section, which will display all starred emails across different folders.

action:
click(bid="144")

2025-05-29 09:57:42,059 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I successfully navigated to the "Starred" category in GoMail. Now I can see the starred emails.

Looking at the current state, I can see:

1. The page title has changed to "Starred - fede.lopez@gmail.com"
2. The pagination text shows "1-13 of 13" which means there are 13 starred emails in total
3. I can see the list of starred emails displayed

The pagination text clearly states "1-13 of 13", which means:
- We're viewing emails 1 through 13
- There are 13 total starred emails

Since the pagination shows "1-13 of 13", this means all starred emails are displayed on this page and there are exactly 13 starred emails in total.

Let me count them to double-check:
1. Email from Support, Your Account Statement is Ready
2. Email from Noreply, Live Stream Alert: Your Favorite Streamer is Now Live  
3. Email from Jane Smith, Project Update: Deadline Extended
4. Email from No Reply, Pull Request Merged: New Changes in Your Repository
5. Email from Calendar Notifications, Reminder: Team Sync-Up at 10:00 AM
6. Email from Support, Payment Received: $100 from John Doe
7. Email from No Reply, Your Files Have Been Successfully Synced
8. Email from Marketing, New Features Added to Adobe Photoshop
9. Email from Alerts, Suspicious Activity Detected on Your Account
10. Email from Newsletter, Breaking News: Election Results Are In
11. Email from Support, Action Required: Security Patch Update Available
12. Email from Newsletter, New Leadership Articles You Can't Miss
13. Email from Support, Your Payment Was Successful

Yes, I can count 13 email entries in the list, which matches the pagination text "1-13 of 13".

The answer is 13 emails in the "Starred" category.

action:
send_msg_to_user(text="There are 13 emails in the \"Starred\" category. This is confirmed by both the pagination indicator showing \"1-13 of 13\" and by counting the individual starred emails displayed on the page.")
