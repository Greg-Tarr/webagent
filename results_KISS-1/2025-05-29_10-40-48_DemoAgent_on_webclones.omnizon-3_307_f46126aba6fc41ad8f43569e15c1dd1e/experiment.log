1. Scroll through the homepage
2. Click on the "Headphones" category card
3. Retrieve all product listings within that category

I'm currently on the Omnizon homepage. Looking at the state, I can see several category sections. Let me first take a screenshot to see the current visual state, then scroll through the homepage to see all available categories.

I can see in the DOM there are several sections with different categories. One section mentions "Wireless Tech" which includes:
- Smartphones
- Watches  
- Headphones
- Tablets

I can see there's an image with 'headphones' at element [454] and text 'Headphones' at [455]. This seems to be what I'm looking for.

But the user said to scroll through the homepage first, so let me do that to get a complete view of all the content before clicking on the headphones category.

Let me start by taking a screenshot to see the current state, then scroll down to see more content.

Looking at the current page state, I can see a "Results" region that contains multiple headphone products. Let me analyze what I can see:

Current headphone products on this page:
1. Sony WH-1000XM5 - $389.00 - Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones
2. JBL Tune 510BT - $39.95 - Wireless On-Ear Headphones 
3. Beats Studio Pro - $349.99 - Wireless Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones
4. Apple AirPods Pro 2 - $249.00 - Wireless Earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation
5. HyperX Cloud III - $99.99 - Wired Gaming Headset

However, I need to check if there are more products on additional pages. The task mentions that I should check for pagination or "next" buttons to count the total number of unique items. I need to explore if there are more pages or if this is all the products.

Looking at the page state, I don't see any obvious pagination elements or "next page" buttons in the current state. Let me scroll down to see if there are more products or pagination controls.

I scrolled down but didn't see any pagination controls or "next page" buttons. The page seems to show just these 5 products. But I should be more thorough and check if there are any more products or pagination controls that I might have missed. Let me take a screenshot to see the current visual state better.

I can see at the bottom of the page there's a "Back to top" link and then the footer content, which suggests this is the end of the product listings. I don't see any pagination controls like "Next page" or page numbers, which indicates that these 5 products represent the complete catalog for the headphones category.

Following the instructions, I should check for pagination carefully before concluding. Let me scroll back up to see if there are any pagination controls at the top of the results section that I might have missed.
