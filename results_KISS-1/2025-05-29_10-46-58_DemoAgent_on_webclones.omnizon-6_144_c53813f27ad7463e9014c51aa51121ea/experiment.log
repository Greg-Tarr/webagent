- Camera: 200MP main camera, 50MP zoom camera
- Features: S Pen included, Circle & Search, Live Translate, Nightography, Generative Edit

- RAM: 12 GB
- Storage: 512GB
- Screen: 7.6 inches (foldable)
- CPU Speed: 3.4 GHz

- Features: Circle to Search, Handsfree Live Interpreter, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, foldable design
- 5G connectivity
- Multiple windows capability
- Gorilla Glass Victus 2, IP48 water resistance

**Comparison Analysis:**

Price difference: Z Fold 6 is $600 more expensive ($2,019.99 vs $1,419.99)

Advantages of S24 Ultra:
- $600 cheaper
- Better camera system (200MP main + 50MP zoom vs unspecified cameras on Z Fold 6)
- S Pen included (great for productivity)
- More established flagship features
- Better processor specified (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy)
- Android 14 vs MIUI 14 (though this might be an error on the listing)

Advantages of Z Fold 6:
- Much larger screen when unfolded (7.6" vs 6.8")


- Innovative foldable design offers unique multitasking potential
- Supports up to three simultaneous windows
- Provides a more versatile productivity experience with its dual-screen configuration

Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra:
- Price: $1,419.99
- Better camera: 200MP main + 50MP zoom
- S Pen included
- Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor
- 6.8" screen with 3120x1440 resolution, 120Hz
- RAM: 12 GB
- Storage: 512GB

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6:
- Price: $2,019.99 (≈$600 more expensive)
- Larger 7.6" foldable screen
- Multiple windows capability
- Unique foldable form factor
- RAM: 12 GB

The S24 Ultra offers much better value for money - it's $600 cheaper while providing superior camera capabilities, the S Pen for productivity, and proven flagship performance.
