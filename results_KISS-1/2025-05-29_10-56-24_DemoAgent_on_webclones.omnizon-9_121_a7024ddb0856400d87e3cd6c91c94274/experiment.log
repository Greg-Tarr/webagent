1. There's a search result for "PlayStation DualSense® Wireless Controller - White"
2. The price is $74.00
3. There's an "Add to cart" button with ID 656
4. But I need to click on the product first to open its details page, then use "buy now" button as requested

Looking at the current state, I can see:
- [633] link 'View details for PlayStation DualSense® Wireless Controller - White' - this looks like the link to the product details page
- [636] link 'View PlayStation DualSense® Wireless Controller - White details' - this also seems like a link to details

I should click on one of these links to open the product details page first, then look for the "buy now" button. Let me click on the first one.

- name: Jack Fulton
- card number: 9231 3432 8927 7764
- exp date: 1/2029

Let me start by filling in the card number first, then name, then expiration date (I'll need to use the dropdowns), then security code. The security code field is currently focused, so I should start with a different field first.

Let me start with the card number field.

- [1076] combobox 'Qty: 1' value='2024' - this shows '2024' so this is likely for the year

I need to set month to 1 (January) and year to 2029. Let me start with the month dropdown. Since the instructions say to use 'click' instead of 'fill' for dropdowns, I'll click on the month dropdown first.
