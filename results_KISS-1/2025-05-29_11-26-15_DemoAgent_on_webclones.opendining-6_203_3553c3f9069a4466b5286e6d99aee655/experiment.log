2025-05-29 11:26:34,082 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to complete the goal: "Select any restaurant and try finishing the booking with the phone number '+1 1111'. Report whether the booking was successful or if there was an error."

Looking at the current page state, I can see:
1. This is the OpenDining website homepage
2. There are several restaurants listed: The Royal Dine, Vintage Bites, Evening Delight, River View Café, and Fancy Lights Bistro
3. Each restaurant has booking buttons for different times (1:30 PM, 2:00 PM, 2:30 PM)
4. I need to select any restaurant and complete a booking with a specific phone number "+1 1111"

Let me think about the approach:
1. First, I should select any restaurant and click on one of its booking buttons
2. This should take me to a booking page where I can fill out the details
3. I'll need to use the phone number "+1 1111" as specified
4. I should try to complete the booking and see if it's successful or if there's an error

Let me start by clicking on the first restaurant's first available time slot to begin the booking process. I'll choose "The Royal Dine" and the "1:30 PM" time slot.

action:
click(bid="85")
