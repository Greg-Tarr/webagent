I can see I'm on the OpenDining homepage, which shows a restaurant booking platform. I can see several restaurants listed:

1. The Royal Dine - French, $$$$, Mission District
2. Vintage Bites - American, $$$$, SOMA  
3. Evening Delight - Italian, $$$$, North Beach
4. River View Café - Café, $$$$, Embarcadero
5. Fancy Lights Bistro - Mediterranean, $$$$, Hayes Valley

I can see these restaurants are repeated in multiple sections on the page. However, I notice that all these restaurants show "$$$$ " which suggests they are all expensive restaurants. But I need to check their actual menus to see the individual dish prices to find the cheapest dish.

The task mentions "search all menus" so I need to visit each restaurant's details page to see their menus and find the prices of individual dishes.

Let me start by exploring if there are more restaurants beyond what's currently visible. I can see there are "Next slide" buttons, so let me click through those first to see if there are more restaurants.

Let me also look for any way to browse all restaurants or search for restaurants. I should be systematic about this.

I see there are several "Next slide" buttons on the page. Let me first explore to see if there are more restaurants visible by clicking through the slides.

I've discovered additional dining options in different San Francisco neighborhoods. The list continues to expand, revealing more diverse culinary choices across the city's unique districts.

13. Sushi Zen offers an exquisite Japanese dining experience in the heart of SOMA, featuring meticulously crafted sushi and an elegant atmosphere. 14. La Trattoria brings authentic Italian cuisine to North Beach, presenting traditional recipes with a sophisticated modern twist. 15. Taco Loco elevates Mexican gastronomy in the Mission District, delivering innovative and high-end interpretations of classic dishes.

I'll continue exploring the culinary landscape with 16. The Vegan Table, a premier plant-based restaurant nestled in Haight-Ashbury that transforms vegan dining into a gourmet experience. 17. Steakhouse 101 represents classic carnivore indulgence in the Financial District, offering premium cuts and an upscale dining environment. 18. Dim Sum Delight captures the vibrant essence of Chinatown's culinary traditions, presenting an elevated approach to traditional Chinese small plates.

The pricing pattern across these establishments reveals a consistent high-end positioning, with most venues commanding top-tier pricing. The emerging pattern suggests an exclusive dining scene where exceptional quality commands premium rates.

Continuing the exploration, 19. Pizza Palace in the Marina District and 20. BBQ Haven in Outer Richmond further expand this upscale dining narrative. Each restaurant seems strategically positioned to offer distinctive culinary experiences within San Francisco's diverse neighborhood landscape.

The pricing uniformity across these restaurants indicates a sophisticated dining market where exceptional quality and unique dining concepts justify substantial price points.

I'll investigate additional carousel sections to uncover more dining options, systematically examining each section's restaurant selections and potential variations in pricing and cuisine types.

2025-05-29 11:51:22,958 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The scroll didn't show changes in page state, which means I need to try a different approach. I can see there are other carousel sections on the page based on what I saw earlier - there was an "Introducing OpenDining Icons" section, an "Award-winning" section, and others. I should check if there are "Next slide" buttons for those other sections too.

Looking at the current state, I can see there are other carousels visible. I noticed there were multiple "Next slide" buttons before - let me check if there are other Next slide buttons for the other sections. I saw elements like [1585] button 'Next slide' and [2293] button 'Next slide' in the previous states.

Let me check the other carousel sections to see if they contain different restaurants or just repeat the same ones. I need to make sure I've found all unique restaurants before I start checking menus.

From what I can remember from the previous states, it looked like the other carousels showed the same restaurants. But I should double-check this systematically.

Now I should start visiting each restaurant's page to check their menus and find the cheapest dish. Since The Royal Dine is the only restaurant with $$$ price level (vs $$$$), I should probably start there as it's most likely to have the cheapest dishes.

Let me start systematically checking the menus of all restaurants. I'll start with The Royal Dine since it has the lower price tier.

It looks like these carousel sections are showing the same restaurants in different arrangements/categories.

Let me continue checking to see if there are any new restaurants in these sections, but it seems like they might all be duplicates of the restaurants I already found.

I should also check the third carousel section to be thorough, then start checking the actual menus of the restaurants I've identified.

I notice one important thing: The Royal Dine is shown as $$$ in the first carousel, but in this second carousel (Icons section), it's showing as $$$$. Let me double-check which one is correct by visiting the restaurant page directly.

Since I've already thoroughly explored the first carousel and found 20 unique restaurants, and these other carousels appear to be showing the same restaurants in different groupings (like "Icons", "Award-winning", etc.), I should now proceed to check the actual menus of all the restaurants I've found.

I have 20 restaurants total:
1. The Royal Dine (French, Mission District) - https://evals-opendining.vercel.app/r/e83c1c2b-9f5b-4a7c-bd54-b165a86a0f3d

7. Spacious Eats (Buffet, Outer Sunset) looks like an interesting option with its diverse dining style. Yellowy Bistro in Dogpatch offers European cuisine, while Crowded Corner represents fast food in the Tenderloin neighborhood. I'll continue documenting these additional restaurant options to complete my comprehensive list.

Expensive Taste provides a fine dining experience in Overtown, promising an upscale culinary journey. Ocean Breeze specializes in seafood at the Embarcadero, likely featuring fresh maritime flavors. Bistro Soleil brings French cuisine to the Mission District, suggesting an authentic European dining atmosphere.

The next set of restaurants continues the diverse culinary landscape. Sushi Zen offers Japanese cuisine in SOMA, potentially delivering traditional and innovative sushi preparations. La Trattoria brings authentic Italian dining to North Beach, hinting at classic Mediterranean flavors. Taco Loco represents Mexican cuisine in the Mission District, promising vibrant and bold tastes. The Vegan Table in Haight-Ashbury suggests a plant-based dining option for health-conscious diners.

Expanding the restaurant collection, Steakhouse 101 in the Financial District likely caters to meat enthusiasts with premium cuts. Dim Sum Delight in Chinatown promises traditional Chinese small plates and shared dining experiences. Pizza Palace in the Marina District rounds out the Italian representation with potentially wood-fired or classic pizza styles.

I'll methodically investigate menu pricing, beginning with The Royal Dine, which has fluctuating price indicators. My systematic approach will involve carefully examining each restaurant's menu to identify the most budget-friendly dish, starting with this establishment.

Remaining restaurants to check:
1. The Vegan Table - https://evals-opendining.vercel.app/r/3f1d4cc8-d8c7-4138-bbc8-754f7736b82d


2. Steakhouse 101 - https://evals-opendining.vercel.app/r/fe378ed1-e4e5-431f-8ef9-3bcbabbf31fa
3. Dim Sum Delight - https://evals-opendining.vercel.app/r/91cb4e63-2f2f-4bde-8e0b-c12d2ec8a672
4. Pizza Palace - https://evals-opendining.vercel.app/r/6a80b14f-bb93-4c9f-9d61-93f75d40b

I'll continue investigating the remaining restaurants, hoping to find an even more budget-friendly option. My current lowest price benchmark is $4.00 from the Carnitas Taco, so I'm searching for anything that might beat that price point.

5. BBQ Haven - https://evals-opendining.vercel.app/r/5c72ec92-0c9f-442c-83e4-3f5f12391e79

Scanning the menu reveals promising affordable selections. The pulled pork sandwich looks particularly appealing at just $3.75, which would actually undercut my current lowest price. This could be an excellent budget choice for diners seeking substantial flavor without breaking the bank.
