From the initial state information I had, I could see all the listings with their prices. Let me review what I found:

From the initial state, I saw many listings with prices ranging from very low to very high. I need to identify the absolute highest and lowest.

Looking through all the listings systematically:

Lowest prices I can identify:
- $14.00 USD - Countryside Haven (Cotswolds) - This appeared to be the lowest
- $19.00 USD - Sunny Cottage (Barcelona)
- $26.00 USD - City Escape (Paris)
- $31.00 USD - City Loft Escape (Paris)
- $34.00 USD - Lakefront Stay (Lake Tahoe)

Highest prices I can identify:
- $996.00 USD - Lakeside Haven (Lake Tahoe) - This appeared to be the highest
- $986.00 USD - Rustic Lodge (Kirkjufell)
- $969.00 USD - Cozy Beach House (Byron Bay)
- $960.00 USD - Mountain Escape (Zermatt)
- $950.00 USD - Seaside Escape (Byron Bay)

So the highest price is $996.00 and the lowest price is $14.00.

The difference would be: $996.00 - $14.00 = $982.00

But I should double-check this by making sure I've seen all the listings properly. Let me take a screenshot to see what's currently visible.
