First, let me understand what I need to do:
1. Book a stay for 2 children + 1 adult = 3 guests total

I can see the search interface at the top with:

Now I can see a long list of vacation rental properties available for those dates. I need to select one of these properties and proceed with the booking. Let me pick a reasonably priced property that would be suitable for a family with children.

Looking at the options, I can see several good choices:

1. "Cabin in the woods" - $127.00 USD/night, 4.00 rating, Asheville
2. "Countryside Haven" - $14.00 USD/night, 4.46 rating, Cotswolds (very cheap!)
3. "City Escape" - $26.00 USD/night, 4.73 rating, Paris (good value)
4. "Sunny Cottage" - $19.00 USD/night, 4.47 rating, Barcelona (good value)
5. "Countryside Retreat" - $211.00 USD/night, 4.43 rating, Cotswolds

I'll choose the "Countryside Haven" since it has a good rating (4.46) and is extremely affordable at $14/night, plus it's family-friendly in the Cotswolds. Let me click on it to proceed with the booking.


I'm navigating to the specific property page by accessing its unique URL, which includes our previously selected dates.
