Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a dashboard page for Topwork (https://evals-topwork.vercel.app/platform/dashboard/). I can see there's a "Post a job" button at element [92].

My goal is to:
1. Click the "Post a job" button to start creating a job post
2. Fill in the details for a UI/UX Designer position
3. Include the required skills (Wireframing, Prototyping, Responsive Design)
4. Mention expertise in Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Creative Suite
5. Include project details and timeline

Let me start by clicking the "Post a job" button.

Based on the goal, I need to create a job post for a UI/UX Designer with expertise in Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Creative Suite, including project details, timeline, and required skills (Wireframing, Prototyping, Responsive Design).

Let me start by filling in an appropriate title for this job post. I should make it clear and compelling, focusing on UI/UX Designer role and mentioning key tools.

A good title might be: "UI/UX Designer needed with Figma, Sketch & Adobe Creative Suite expertise"

Let me fill this in the textbox.

action:
fill(bid="499", value="UI/UX Designer needed with Figma, Sketch & Adobe Creative Suite expertise")

- The title mentions UI/UX Designer ✓
- It mentions Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Creative Suite ✓
- It's a strong, clear title that would stand out ✓

The current state looks correct - the textbox now shows the title I filled in and it's focused. I can see this is step 1/5 of the job posting process. Now I should click "Next: Skills" to proceed to the next step where I'll likely be able to add more details about the required skills (Wireframing, Prototyping, Responsive Design) and other project details.

Now I have five skills selected: Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite, Wireframing, and Prototyping. I still need to add the last required skill: "Responsive Design". The page recommends 3-5 skills for best results, and I'll have 6 total which should be fine.

Let me add "Responsive Design" now.

This covers all the skills mentioned in the goal. I now have 6 skills selected which is within the recommended 3-5 range (actually slightly above, but that should be fine). 

Now I need to proceed to the next step to continue building the job post. I can see the "Next: Scope" button at the bottom. Let me click it to continue to step 3/5.

action:
click(bid="513")

2025-05-29 13:19:12,859 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-29 13:19:12,891 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! Now I'm on step 3/5 which is about estimating the scope of work. I need to make some decisions about:

1. Project size (Large/Medium/Small)
2. Timeline (More than 6 months / 3 to 6 months / 1 to 3 months)
3. Experience level (Entry/Intermediate/Expert)
4. Contract-to-hire opportunity (Yes/No)

For a UI/UX Designer job, let me think about what would be appropriate:

1. Project size: For a UI/UX design project, "Medium" seems most appropriate as it's described as "Well-defined projects (ex. a landing page)" which fits well with typical UI/UX design work.

2. Timeline: For UI/UX design work, "1 to 3 months" seems reasonable for most projects.

3. Experience level: Since we're looking for expertise in specific tools (Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite) and skills (Wireframing, Prototyping, Responsive Design), "Intermediate" would be appropriate - looking for substantial experience in this field.

4. Contract-to-hire: I'll choose "No, not at this time" to keep it focused on the project work.

Let me make these selections.

For a UI/UX design project, "1 to 3 months" seems like a reasonable timeframe, so let me select that option.

Since this is for a UI/UX Designer position that requires expertise in specific tools like Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Creative Suite, plus skills like wireframing, prototyping, and responsive design, I should select "Intermediate" as it represents someone with substantial experience in the field.

Now I need to make the final selection for the contract-to-hire opportunity. For a UI/UX design position, I should select "No, not at this time" as it's more typical for these types of projects to be contract-based without necessarily being a contract-to-hire arrangement.

Let me select that option.

action:
click(bid="757")

1. Project size: "Medium" (selected)
2. Timeline: "1 to 3 months" (selected)  
3. Experience level: "Intermediate" (selected)
4. Contract-to-hire: "No, not at this time" (selected)

All required fields appear to be filled out for this step. Now I can proceed to the next step by clicking "Next: Budget" to continue building the job post.

2025-05-29 13:19:55,385 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Now I'm on step 4/5 where I need to set the budget. I can see:

1. "Hourly rate" is currently selected (radio button checked='true')
2. There's also a "Fixed price" option
3. There are two spinbutton fields for "From" and "To" hourly rates
4. The page mentions this is for "Ecommerce Website Development projects" but that seems to be generic text since we're creating a UI/UX Designer job

For a UI/UX Designer position, I should set appropriate hourly rates. Let me fill in reasonable rates for intermediate-level UI/UX designers. I'll set a range like $30-60 per hour which is typical for intermediate UI/UX designers.

Let me fill in the "From" field first:

Now I need to fill in the "To" field to complete the hourly rate range. For an intermediate UI/UX designer with expertise in the required tools, I should set an upper range. Let me set it to something like $60 to provide a good range for intermediate level designers.

action:
fill(bid="816", value="60")

- To: $60/hr

This is a reasonable range for an intermediate UI/UX designer. Now I need to proceed to the final step which is the description section. I can see the "Next: Description" button is available.

I can see that the progress bar shows 100% completion and I'm on the "Start the conversation" page where I need to describe what I need. I can see there's a textbox for the job description and the button has changed to "Submit Job Post".

I need to write a comprehensive job description for a UI/UX Designer position that includes:
