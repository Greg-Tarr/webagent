2025-05-29 13:24:45,632 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to compare two front-end freelancers based on their work history, success rate, and client feedback. I'm currently on a dashboard page that shows some freelancers.

Looking at the current state, I can see several freelancers listed:

1. Brian K. - Full Stack Developer from Colombia, $15.00/hr, rating 4.5, 120 jobs
2. Carol A. - UI/UX Designer from Spain, $40.00/hr, rating 4.8, 95 jobs
3. Charles D. - Data Scientist from China, $60.00/hr, rating 4.7, 110 jobs
4. Chris O. - Blockchain Expert from Morocco, $70.00/hr, rating 4.9, 80 jobs

And there are also experts listed:
1. Alexa R. - Full Stack Developer from United States, $50.00/hr, rating 4.5, 120 jobs
2. Angela W. - UI/UX Designer from Spain, $40.00/hr, rating 4.8, 95 jobs
3. Ashley C. - Data Scientist from China, $60.00/hr, rating 4.7, 110 jobs
4. Brandon M. - Blockchain Expert from Morocco, $70.00/hr, rating 4.9, 80 jobs

For front-end freelancers, I should focus on those with relevant skills. From what I can see:
- Brian K. is a Full Stack Developer (could do front-end)
- Alexa R. is also a Full Stack Developer (could do front-end)
- Carol A. and Angela W. are UI/UX Designers (related to front-end)

But I need to find specifically front-end developers and get more detailed information about their work history, success rate, and client feedback. The current page only shows basic info like ratings and number of jobs.

I should explore the platform to find front-end freelancers specifically. 

I spot the "Talent" navigation option and decide to investigate further. This could be my gateway to finding specialized front-end talent with more comprehensive profiles. I'll click through and see what detailed information I can uncover about potential candidates who match my front-end development requirements.

I need to find front-end freelancers specifically. The Full Stack Developers (Brian K. and Alexa R.) would likely have front-end skills. Let me click on one of them to get more detailed information.

Actually, let me first check if there's a specific way to search for front-end developers. I should try the search functionality or see if I can navigate to a talent browsing page.

Let me try clicking on "Talent" first to see if there's a proper talent search interface.
