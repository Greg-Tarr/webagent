2025-05-29 13:34:38,814 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The user wants me to book a ride from "Fitness Urbano" to "Pacific Cafe" using this Udriver service. Looking at the current state, I can see that this is the Udriver homepage which looks like an Uber-like service.

I can see there are two comboboxes:
1. "Enter Location" (pickup location) - this should be "Fitness Urbano"
2. "Enter Destination" - this should be "Pacific Cafe"

There's also a "See prices for your ride" button/link that goes to the trip page.

Let me start by filling in the pickup location first. I should click on the first combobox to enter "Fitness Urbano".

action:
click(bid="108")

2025-05-29 13:34:47,158 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! I clicked on the "Enter Location" combobox and it has opened up a dropdown with location options. I can see several options listed:
- 1 Hotel San Francisco - 8 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA
- 100 Van Ness - 100 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA  
- 1000 Chestnut Street Apartments - 1000 Chestnut St, San Francisco, CA 94109, USA
- 1001 Castro Street - 1001 Castro St, San Francisco, CA 94114, USA

However, I need to look for "Fitness Urbano" which is not in this initial list. I should type "Fitness Urbano" to search for it, as this appears to be an autocomplete search box.

action:
fill(bid="108", value="Fitness Urbano")
