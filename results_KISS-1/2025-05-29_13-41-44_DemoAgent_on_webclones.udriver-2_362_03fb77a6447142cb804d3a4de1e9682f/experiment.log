2025-05-29 13:41:58,052 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - The user is asking about "the name of the Thai restaurant I last got a ride to". This suggests I need to look at ride history to find the most recent ride to a Thai restaurant. 

I'm currently on the Udriver homepage (https://evals-udriver.vercel.app/). I can see there's a user menu with "Federico" which likely contains account information and ride history.

Let me think about what I need to do:
1. First, I need to access the user menu to see if there's a ride history section
2. Look through the ride history to find the most recent ride to a Thai restaurant
3. Get the name of that restaurant

Let me start by clicking on the user menu to see what options are available.

action:
click(bid="88")

This is likely where I can find the ride history to see the last Thai restaurant the user went to. Let me click on "Activity" to access the ride history.

2025-05-29 13:42:18,004 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see the ride history on this page. Looking at the trip list, I can see several trips including:

1. The Landing San Francisco Apartments - 6/13/2024 6:17:48 PM
2. Avis Car Rental - 6/13/2024 10:45:32 AM  
3. The Landing San Francisco Apartments - 6/12/2024 9:04:31 PM
4. Phat Thai - 6/12/2024 8:12:49 PM
5. The Landing San Francisco Apartments - 6/10/2024 7:22:12 PM

The user is asking for the last Thai restaurant they went to. Looking at the chronological order (most recent first), I can see "Phat Thai" on 6/12/2024 8:12:49 PM. This appears to be the most recent Thai restaurant trip.

However, I should check if there are more trips by clicking "Show more trips" to make sure I'm not missing any more recent Thai restaurant visits. The trips are listed chronologically with the most recent first, so if there were a more recent Thai restaurant trip, it would appear above "Phat Thai".

Looking at the dates:
- 6/13/2024 6:17:48 PM - The Landing San Francisco Apartments
- 6/13/2024 10:45:32 AM - Avis Car Rental  
- 6/12/2024 9:04:31 PM - The Landing San Francisco Apartments
- 6/12/2024 8:12:49 PM - Phat Thai

"Phat Thai" is clearly the most recent Thai restaurant in the visible list. But I should click "Show more trips" to see if there are any more recent trips that might include another Thai restaurant.

action:
click(bid="288")

2025-05-29 13:42:35,943 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Let me analyze the ride history carefully to find the last Thai restaurant:

Looking at the trips in chronological order (most recent first):

1. "The Landing San Francisco Apartments" - 6/13/2024 at 6:17:48 PM
2. "Avis Car Rental" - 6/13/2024 at 10:45:32 AM  
3. "The Landing San Francisco Apartments" - 6/12/2024 at 9:04:31 PM
4. "Phat Thai" - 6/12/2024 at 8:12:49 PM (THIS IS A THAI RESTAURANT!)
5. "The Landing San Francisco Apartments" - 6/10/2024 at 7:22:12 PM
6. "Pacific Catch" - 6/10/2024 at 6:15:30 PM

So looking at this chronologically, "Phat Thai" on 6/12/2024 at 8:12:49 PM appears to be the most recent Thai restaurant visit. Let me double-check if there could be more recent trips by seeing if there's a way to show more trips or if this is all the data available.

I notice the "Show more trips" button is gone now, which suggests I've seen all available trips. Pacific Catch doesn't appear to be a Thai restaurant (sounds more like a seafood place), and all the other trips after Phat Thai are to apartments and car rental.

So the answer should be "Phat Thai" - this was the last Thai restaurant the user got a ride to, on 6/12/2024.

Let me double-check this is correct before proceeding. Looking at the dates:
- Most recent is 6/13/2024 (apartments and car rental)
- Then 6/12/2024 (apartments and "Phat Thai")  
- Then 6/10/2024 (apartments and "Pacific Catch")


I've confirmed with absolute certainty that Phat Thai represents the final Thai restaurant destination in the ride history.

action:
send_msg_to_user(text="The name of the Thai restaurant you last got a ride to was \"Phat Thai\". This trip took place on June 12, 2024 at 8:12:49 PM.")
