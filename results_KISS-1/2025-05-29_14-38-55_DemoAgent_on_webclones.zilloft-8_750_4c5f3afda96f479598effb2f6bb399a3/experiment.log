2025-05-29 14:39:09,674 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I need to help the user find homes with specific criteria on this real estate website. The goal is to:

1. Apply a filter for homes with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a price range between $600,000 and $800,000 for zipcode 92114
2. Count how many results are displayed

Looking at the current state, I'm on the Zilloft homepage. I can see several options:
- There's a search box for homes by address, neighborhood, city or ZIP code
- There's a "Browse available homes" button
- There's a "Browse homes" button

I should start by searching for the specific zipcode 92114 to see what options come up. Let me use the search box first.

action:
fill(bid="94", value="92114")

1. First search for zipcode 92114 (which I already filled in)
2. Click "Start search" to search for homes in that area
3. Then apply filters for 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and price range $600,000-$800,000
4. Count the total number of results

Let me start by clicking the "Start search" button.

action:
click(bid="96")

2025-05-29 14:39:25,986 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - I can see I'm now on a search results page for homes. The page is currently loading (I can see a "Searching for results..." message and a loading indicator). The search bar shows "92114" which is correct.

I can see filter buttons available:
- "For Sale" button
- "Price" button  
- "Beds & Baths" button
- "Home Type" button

I need to apply filters for:
1. 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (using the "Beds & Baths" button)
2. Price range between $600,000 and $800,000 (using the "Price" button)

Let me wait for the page to finish loading first, then apply the filters. I should start with the "Beds & Baths" filter since that's one of the requirements.

2025-05-29 14:39:40,888 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! I can see the search results for zipcode 92114. The page shows "2 results" and I can see two properties listed:

1. 6526 Crabtree St, San Diego, CA 92114 - $860,000, 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 1,634 sqft
2. 174 Coolwater Dr, San Diego, CA 92114 - $625,000, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1,375 sqft

However, I need to apply the specific filters requested:
- 3 bedrooms
- 2 bathrooms  
- Price range between $600,000 and $800,000

Looking at the current results without filters:
- The first property has 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, priced at $860,000 (outside the price range)
- The second property has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, priced at $625,000 (within the price range)

So without filters, only 1 of the 2 properties would meet the criteria. But I need to apply the actual filters to get the accurate filtered results.

I can see the filter buttons available:
- [972] button 'For Sale', hasPopup='menu', expanded=False
- [978] button 'Price', hasPopup='menu', expanded=False  
- [984] button 'Beds & Baths', hasPopup='menu', expanded=False
- [990] button 'Home Type', hasPopup='menu', expanded=False

I need to:
1. Click on "Price" to set the price range $600,000-$800,000
2. Click on "Beds & Baths" to set 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms
3. Then count the final filtered results

Let me start with the Price filter.

action:

I can see the minimum price combobox (currently set to "No Min") and the maximum price combobox (currently set to "No Max"). I need to set the minimum to $600,000 and the maximum to $800,000.

First, let me select the minimum price of $600,000. I can see option [1252] with '$600,000'.

action:
select_option(bid="1239", options="$600,000")

Now I need to apply this price filter by clicking the "APPLY" button, and then I'll need to set the bedrooms and bathrooms filters.

Let me check the current state:
- Minimum price: $600,000 ✓
- Maximum price: $800,000 ✓
- Still need to set: 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms

I can see the APPLY button at the bottom with bid [1976], so let me click that first to apply the price range.

action:

I can see that the price filter has been applied successfully - it now shows "$600K - $800K" on the button, indicating the price range filter is active. The page is currently loading with a progress bar showing "Searching for results...". 

I need to wait for the results to load, and then I still need to apply the bedrooms and bathrooms filter (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms). Let me wait for the loading to complete first.

2025-05-29 14:40:30,646 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Great! The search results have loaded and I can see:

1. The price range filter is applied: $600K - $800K
2. The search is for zipcode 92114 
3. There is currently "1 result" displayed

I can see one property listed:
- 174 Coolwater Dr, San Diego, CA 92114
- $625,000 (which is within the $600,000-$800,000 range)
- 3 bds | 2 ba | 1,375 sqft - House for sale

So this property has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, which matches exactly what we need. However, I still need to apply the "Beds & Baths" filter to specifically filter for 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms to ensure we're getting the exact filtered results as requested.

I can see there's a "Beds & Baths" button that I need to click to apply those specific filters.

action:
click(bid="984")

2025-05-29 14:40:41,131 - agisdk.REAL.browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - Perfect! The Beds & Baths filter menu has opened. I can see:

For bedrooms:
- Any, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ options
- An "Use exact match" checkbox that is currently not checked

For bathrooms:
- Any, 1+, 1.5+, 2+, 3+, 4+ options

I need to select:
- 3+ bedrooms (but since I want exactly 3 bedrooms, I should probably check the "Use exact match" option first, then select 3+)
- 2+ bathrooms (but again, if I want exactly 2 bathrooms, I should use exact match)

Actually, let me think about this. The goal says "3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms" - this could mean "exactly 3 bedrooms and exactly 2 bathrooms" or "at least 3 bedrooms and at least 2 bathrooms". Let me check if there's an exact match option.

I see there's a "Use exact match" radio button. Let me first click that to enable exact matching, then select 3+ for bedrooms and 2+ for bathrooms.

2. The price filter button shows "$600K - $800K" - ✓ correct price range
3. The beds & baths filter button shows "3+ bd, 2+ ba" - ✓ correct bedroom and bathroom filters

I can see there's a loading indicator that says "Searching for results..." and there's a progressbar showing that the search is in progress. The page shows "0 Homes For Sale" in the title currently, but that's likely because it's still loading.

I need to wait for the search results to finish loading to see how many results are displayed.

1. ✓ Zipcode: 92114 (confirmed in search box and heading "92114 Real Estate & Homes For Sale")
2. ✓ Price range: $600K - $800K (shown in filter button)
3. ✓ Bedrooms & Bathrooms: 3+ bd, 2+ ba (shown in filter button)

Most importantly, I can see the results:
- The page shows "1 result" 
- There is one property listed: "174 Coolwater Dr, San Diego, CA 92114"
- Price: $625,000 (which is within the $600K-$800K range)
- Details: 3 bds | 2 ba | 1,375 sqft - House for sale

So all filters have been successfully applied and the number of results displayed is 1.

Let me double-check this is correct:
- The property shown has 3 bedrooms ✓
- The property shown has 2 bathrooms ✓  
- The price $625,000 is between $600,000 and $800,000 ✓
- The zipcode is 92114 ✓

Perfect! The task has been completed successfully. The answer is 1 result.
